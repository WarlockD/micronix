this contains tools that run under unix to manipulate micronix artifacts

for now, these are

nm.c:  dump out the symbol table and relocation information from whitesmith
       object files

fslib.c:  a library to handle file system operations

ncheck.c: the standard, old unix v6 file system checkers
icheck.c
dcheck.c

copyall.c:  extract files from a floppy image

dumpfs.c: dump out filesystem structures

dis is a disassembler that can consume:
	hex dumps, intel hex, microsoft rel, motorola Srecords,
	whitesmiths's objects
	moreover, it can disassemble z80, z180, z280, and you can
	add more architectures by writing a architecture description
        file.
