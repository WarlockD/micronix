NAME
    prl -- "page reelocatable" format

DESCRIPTION
    Prl ("page relocatable") is a file format for relocatable object code
    defined in the Mpm users manual. It begins with a 256 byte header:

    header[0]           Octal 375. Not documented by Mpm.
    header[1 to 2]      Program size (low byte first).
    header[3]           Not documented by Mpm.
    header[4 to 5]      Size of any required buffer space (low byte first).
    header[6 to 255]    Currently unused, reserved by Mpm.

    Next comes "program-size" bytes of binary object code assembled at
    address 0.

    Finally comes a "bit map", one bit for each byte of code, beginning
    with the most significant bit of the map's first byte. A 1 bit
    indicates that the corresponding byte of code should be relocated by
    adding to it the most significant byte of the load address.

    The usual way to make a prl file is to assemble the source code twice,
    once at 0 and once at 100 hex. Then build the map by comparing the
    bytes one-for-one, setting the corresponding bit to the difference.
    If two bytes differ by more than 1, then some non-relocatable
    construct has been used.

BUGS
    The load address must be on a page boundry (multiple of 256).
