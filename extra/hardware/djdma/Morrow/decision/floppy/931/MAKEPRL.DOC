 NAME
    MAKEPRL - make a .PRL file from absolute hex files


SYNOPSIS
    MAKEPRL [-s hex number] [-o output file] hex1 hex2


DESCRIPTION
    MAKEPRL   is   used   to  create  .PRL  files   suitable  for 
    loading by the INSTALL program (see  INSTALL.DOC).   The for
    mat  for  .PRL files can be found in PRL.DOC. 

    The -s option is used for entering the reserved buffer space.   
    (The   reserved   buffer   space  is  entered   as  a  16-bit 
    number   in   addresses  4  and  5   of   the   header,   see 
    PRL.DOC).  

    The   -o option is the output file specifier.   If no  output 
    file is specified, the name  from  hex1  is taken  with  .PRL 
    type  extension added.  If the output file does not  have   a  
    type  extension the  default .PRL is  added.  

    The   next   two  arguments  must  be  specified.  The  first 
    argument is  the  hex  file  input with  an  origin at 0. The 
    second  is  the second hex file input with an origin  at  100 
    hex.  If the hex files do not have a type extension,   '.hx0'  
    and  '.hx1'  are  added respectively.


EXAMPLES
    To  create  a .PRL file of the hard disk I/O drivers,   begin 
    with  the  assembly  language source.  Assemble  it  at  ori
    gin   0  and rename the hex output (with a .'hx0' extension.)  
    Then assemble  it  again  with an origin of 100  hex.   (Con
    sult your assembler manual on how to do this.  With some  as
    semblers,  you  must  re-edit the source file and change  the 
    'org' statement).  After  you  have assembled the source with 
    an origin of 100 hex,  rename it with a '.hx1' extension. Now 
    you are ready to use  the  MAKEPRL  program.  

    This   is   an example of a typical way to do  the  procedure 
    described above.  The example   assumes   that   the   source  
    is  configured correctly.

          mac hd+dj                          
          ren hd+dj.hx0=hd+dj.hex
          mac hd+dj $+r
          ren hd+dj.hx1=hd+dj.hex
          makeprl -o hd+dj.prl hd+dj.hx0 hd+dj.hx1


     In the MAKEPRL line it is not required that you specify
     the output or add type extensions because  the  program
     uses defaults. The MAKEPRL line could be written:
          makeprl hd+dj hd+dj

    This  form does the same as the first but is quicker to type.

    The specification for the -s  option  must  be  a  four digit 
    hex number.
