this is the only native Z80/8080 C compiler I count find source for.

it is being edited to become compilable under unix/linux, so it can be a cross
compiler, and additionally, to be more easily maintained.

it is decidedly non-ansi, with a few real problems in compilation.

it has some minimal z80 stuff, specifically the use of IX as a register variable,
using DE as a frame pointer.   this is pretty lame, since IY would be more useful.
