.ti -8
boot	The bootstrapping programs have been extended
to work without the intervention of CP/M.
The stand-alone floppy will boot directly,
and a boot disk can be prepared that will
boot any of the hard disks without user
intervention. See boot (I).

.ti -8
cal	The "calendar" command has been added. It prints
yearly or monthly calendars.

.ti -8
chmod	The "change mode" command replaces the old "mode" command.
This deals with file modes symbolically,
not just with octal numbers.
Also, the new write lock attribute is supported (see below).

.ti -8
cu	The "call up" command has been added. This allows you
to communicate with other computers via modem.

.ti -8
diff	Works better with the -e option.

.ti -8
far	Is faster.
Copies files of length 0 correctly;
Works with Northstar CP/M 2.x  5 1/4 " single sided
double density 35 track 10 hole hard sectored floppys;

.ti -8
fsck	Works with mis-directed parent links.

.ti -8
init	In version 1.3, Micronix always powered up in single user
mode with a super-user shell. Under 1.4, it demands the
root password (if any) first. This provides more security
for installations that can't physically protect their
computers. You should be sure to keep a stand-alone
floppy with an unprotected root account, however, in
case the root password is lost.

.ti -8
io	The kernel's io interface has been unbundled and
documented so that device drivers can be added
without the source code. This is available as an
option.

.ti -8
iodev	A character device to read and write io space
has been added.

.ti -8
lock	The kernel has been extended to allow a type of
file locking. A file can be marked as "one writer
only", so that no more than one process can hold
the file open for writing. The mark is the 01000
(octal) mode bit in the file's inode.
It is reported by an l in the file's listing,
and can be set with a +l argument to the chmod command.

.ti -8
memdev	A devive to read and write memory is supported.

.ti -8
nice	The kernel and the shell now support user setable priorities.
For example, the command line "nice 4 program &" will run the
given program in the background at a "nice" priority of 4.

.ti -8
passwd	Encrypted passwords are now kept in the /etc/passwd file,
along with all other user account information.
Also, the entry that specifies the user's login shell
can include arguments (as in ":/bin/upm a:/cpm mbasic").

.ti -8
pilot	A version of Pilot has been added. This is an "author
language" suited for writing interactive dialogs.

.ti -8
ps	The "process status" command is supported.

.ti -8
ratfor	Bug fixed.

.ti -8
rm	Works with the -r (recursive) option.

.ti -8
rp	"Rational Pilot" has been added. This is a pre-processor
that makes it easier to write structured Pilot programs.
It pre-processes pilot in exactly the same way that
ratfor pre-processes fortran.

.ti -8
stty	An option has been added to preserve all 8 tty input bits.
This allows support of non-ascii 8-bit character sets.

.ti -8
su	The "set user" command has been added.
It invokes a shell with the
user-id of the named user, or if no user is named,
invokes a super-user shell. Requires the user's
password, if any. (The super-user password is that of
the "root" account.)

.ti -8
sum	Works with the standard input.
Has a -r option.

.ti -8
upm	Lets you specify the command to be run in the .upm file;
TPA size has been increased to 54700 bytes;
Does return status error reporting (like Illegal
instruction -- core dumped);
BIOS jmp table properly positioned;
Tab expansion on console ouput fixed;
Lst device redirection fixed;
Bugs related to too many open files have been fixed.

.ti -8
wall	The "write all" command has been added.
It broadcasts a message to all users.
