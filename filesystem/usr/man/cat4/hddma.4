          The  HDDMA  controls  up  to four 5 1/4 inch Winchester
          disk drives. Micronix currently supports 3 drive sizes:
          
               m5      5 megabytes
               m10     10 megabytes
               m16     16 megabytes
          
          The device names (in  the  /dev  directory)  for  these
          disks   depend   on   their   position   on  the  HDDMA
          daisy-chain. An m5 attached as drive A is called "m5a",
          an m16 attached as drive D is called "m16d",  etc.  The
          major/minor device numbers are as follows:
          
               3/0  m5a        3/4  m10a       3/8  m16a
               3/1  m5b        3/5  m10b       3/9  m16b
               3/2  m5c        3/6  m10c       3/10 m16c
               3/3  m5d        3/7  m10d       3/11 m16d
          
          Micronix does not support a disk formatting program, so
          each  drive must be formatted under CP/M. A sector skew
          of 6 is recommended, but is not critical.  Since  these
          drives  are  soft-sectored,  there  is no compatibility
          problem with different skews.
          
          If you ever have to explore the surface of one of these
          drives without the intervention of Micronix, you should
          know that Micronix  logically  "rolls"  the  tracks  by
          (number  of  tracks)  / 2. Thus on an m5, which has 153
          tracks, logical track  0  is  physical  track  76.  The
          reason for this is that most Micronix systems have only
          one hard disk, which must serve as both the root device
          and the swap device. When Micronix sees that rootdev ==
          swapdev,  it  uses  the  space above the file system as
          swap space. Thus, the logical disk looks like:
          
                ilist           file space             swap space
               |-------|-----------------------------|------------|
               
          while the physical disk looks like:
               
                file space   swap space   ilist     file space
               ------------|------------|-------|-----------------
          
          In a busy system, the disk heads spend  most  of  their
          time over the swap space and the ilist, so this gives a
          performance advantage.
