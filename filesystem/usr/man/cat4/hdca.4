          The  HDCA  controls  up  to four 8 inch Winchester disk
          drives. Micronix currently supports 3 drive sizes:
          
               m10      10 megabytes
               m20      20 megabytes
               m26      26 megabytes
          
          The device names (in  the  /dev  directory)  for  these
          disks depend on their position on the HDCA daisy-chain.
          Drive  A is called "hda", drive B is called "hdb", etc.
          The major/minor device numbers are:
          
               1/0  hda      1/1  hdb      1/2  hdc      1/3  hdd
          
          Unlike the HDDMA  drives,  Micronix  can  automatically
          detect the size of the HDCA drives, so there is no need
          to  indicate  the  drive  size  in  the  device name or
          number.
          
          Micronix does not support a disk formatting program, so
          each drive must be formatted under CP/M. A sector  skew
          of  6  is recommended, but is not critical. Since these
          drives are soft-sectored,  there  is  no  compatibility
          problem with different skews.
