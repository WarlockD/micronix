          The DJDMA provides access for up to eight 8 inch and/or
          5  1/4 inch floppy disk drives (limited to four of each
          type). At present, there may  be  only  one  controller
          board per system.
          
          Diskettes   used   with  MOS  must  be  formatted.  The
          following formats are supported. They are  listed  with
          the number of blocks per disk (a block is 512 bytes).
          
          Inches  Format
          
              8 - 128 byte sectors, single-sided, 487 blocks
              8 - 128 byte sectors, double-sided, 975 blocks* 
              8 - 256 byte sectors, single-sided, 975 blocks
              8 - 256 byte sectors, double-sided, 1950 blocks
              8 - 512 byte sectors, single-sided, 1125 blocks
              8 - 512 byte sectors, double-sided, 2250 blocks
              8 - 1024 byte sectors, single-sided, 1200 blocks
              8 - 1024 byte sectors, double-sided, 2400 blocks
          
              5 1/4 - 256 byte sectors, single-sided, 35 track, 160 blocks
              5 1/4 - 512 byte sectors, single-sided, 35 track, 330 blocks
              5 1/4 - 512 byte sectors, double-sided, 35 track, 660 blocks
          
              5 1/4 - 512 byte sectors, single-sided, 40 track, 380 blocks
              5 1/4 - 512 byte sectors, double-sided, 40 track, 760 blocks
              5 1/4 - 512 byte sectors, single-sided, 80 track, 780 blocks
              5 1/4 - 512 byte sectors, double-sided, 80 track, 1560 blocks
          
              * not recommended
          
          Note that because of reserved tracks (usually the first
          two), the available space is reduced slightly.
          
          All  8  inch  formats  are standard 77 track. While you
          gain approximately 7% in additional capacity with  1024
          byte  sectors on an 8 inch floppy diskette, the loss in
          transfer speed is considerable. The optimum choice  for
          Micronix  floppy  diskettes  is  512-bytes,  single  or
          double.
          
          The   other   formats   are   included   for   backward
          compatibility.  Alternate  sectoring  is  optional  and
          available by selecting  the  appropriate  minor  device
          number  from  the  table below. (Alternate sectoring is
          recommended because it doubles the reading  speed,  but
          does not make much difference in writing speed.)

          Note  that  alternate  and non-alternate sectored media
          are incompatible (i.e., the sectors appear  scrambled).
          The  ffaarr  utility  (see  Section  1)  can  read  a CP/M
          formatted diskette under either alternate  or  straight
          sectoring, however.
          
          The minor device numbers correspond as follows:

                 1      8" - drive 1

                 7      5 1/4" - drive 3
          
                 8      8" - drive 0 with alternate sectoring
                 9      8" - drive 1 with alternate sectoring
                10      8" - drive 2 with alternate sectoring
                11      8" - drive 3 with alternate sectoring
          
                12      5 1/4" - drive 0 with alternate sectoring
                13      5 1/4" - drive 1 with alternate sectoring
                14      5 1/4" - drive 2 with alternate sectoring
                15      5 1/4" - drive 3 with alternate sectoring
          
          
          Note that there are 96-track 5 1/4" drives and 48-track
          5  1/4"  drives. For example, if you have only 48 track
          drives, you cannot
