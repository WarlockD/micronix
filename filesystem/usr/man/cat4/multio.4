          The  Micronix mmuullttiioo interface supports all features of
          the Mult/IO and Wunderbuss  I/O  boards.  It  will  run
          unchanged  in  rack  mount  or  table top models of the
          Decision I.
          
          The  Mult/IO  board   has   three   ACEs   (Asyncronous
          Communication  Elements)  and  1  parallel port for I/O
          device connection. The ACEs  communicate  via  standard
          RS232 serial interface. The parallel port is a standard
          Diablo (50-pin daisy-wheel) interface.
          
          Each Mult/IO board must have its I/O port addresses set
          by  means  of switches on the circuit board. For proper
          operation, the base I/O address must be  48  (hex)  for
          the first Mult/IO board.
          
          In  a  Micronix system in which there are possibly many
          Mult/IO boards,  the  boards  form  a  series.  In  the
          Decision   I   Table  Top  model,  the  Wunderbuss  I/O
          motherboard functions  as  the  first  of  the  series.
          Micronix   expects  to  find  the  Mult/IO  boards  (or
          Wunderbuss) as I/O (hex)  locations  48,  58,  68,  78,
          88,...
          
          Minor  device  numbers  0-3  refer to the Mult/IO board
          addresses at I/O location 48 hex.
          
          Minor device numbers 4-7 refer  to  the  Mult/IO  board
          addresses at location 58 hex, and so on with 68, 78 ...
          
          The  first  minor  device  number of each group of four
          refers to the parallel printer  on  that  board.  Minor
          device   numbers  0,  4,  8,  etc.  refer  to  parallel
          printers.
          
          Bytes sent to the  parallel  printer  device  have  the
          following format:

             Bit-0  is the least significant bit and bit-7 is the
             most significant bit in this discussion.
             
             If bit-7 is clear, the the byte is taken to  mean  a
             character to be printed. Otherwise, if bit-7 is set,
             the byte indicates a motion command.
             
             If bit-6 is set, the byte indicates vertical motion.
             
             If  bit-5  is  set,  the  byte  indicates  backwards
             motion.

             Bits 0 - 4 (the low order 5 bits) are  taken  to  be
             the magnitude of motion desired.

          The  unit of motion is 1/120" for horizontal motion and
          1/48" for vertical motion.
          
          If you want to move farther  than  31  increments,  you
          must send a series of motion bytes.
          
          These  are  accumulated and optimized, then sent all at
          once.
          
          Note  that  this  scheme  allows  elaborate  high-level
          interface. Even several different interfaces, each with
          its  own  set of escape sequences or what have you, all
          translate to common Mult/IO parallel printer motion and
          print byte formats.
