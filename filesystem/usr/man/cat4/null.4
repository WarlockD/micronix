          The   null   device   has  the  curious  property  that
          everything written to  it  is  completely  ignored  and
          thrown  away. Reading from this device yields an end of
          file every time.
          
          The minor device number is ignored.  The  major  device
          number is zero in the current implementation.
          
          This  device  may seem to be of limited usefulness, but
          don't get rid of it, the shell uses it to  set  up  the
          standard input of background processes.
