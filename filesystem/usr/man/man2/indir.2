FUNCTION    
.in +5
.br
The system call at the location syscall is executed.
Execution resumes after the
.bd
indir
call.

The main purpose of
.bd
indir
is to allow programs to
construct system calls in their data segments,
avoiding modifications to their code.

The system call at syscall must begin with the
"sys" byte. An
.bd
indir
executed indirectly is a no-op.


.in -5
.bd
RETURNS
.in +5
.br
The returns depend on the indirectly executed call.
