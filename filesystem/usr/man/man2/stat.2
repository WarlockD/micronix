FUNCTION       
.in +5
.br
.bd
Stat
is identical to
.bd
fstat,
except that it operates on named files
rather than open-file descriptors.
Buf is the address of a 36 byte buffer,
into which the following information is
placed:

.nf
.bd 15
struct stat
	{
char	minor,		/* minor device */
	major;		/* major device */
int	inumber,	/* inode number */
	flags;		/* see below */
char	nlinks,		/* number of links */
	uid,		/* user id of owner */
	gid,		/* group id of owner */
	size0;		/* high byte of size */
int	size1,		/* low word of size */
	addr[8];	/* block numbers */
long	actime,		/* time of last access */
	modtime;	/* " last modification */
	};

The flags are as follows (values in octal):

.bd 15
 100000		inode is allocated
 	 060000		2-bit file type
	 000000		plain file
	 040000		directory
	 020000		character-special file
 060000		block-special file
 010000		large file
 004000		set user-id on execution
 002000		set group-id on execution
 001000		one writer only
 000400		read (owner)
 000200		write (owner)
 000100		execute or search directory (owner)
 000070		read, write, execute (group)
 000007		read, write, execute (others)


.fi
The one-writer-only bit allows the file to be open for
writing in no more than one process at a time.

It is not necessary to have read permission on the file,
but all directories leading to the file must be searchable.


.in -5

RETURNS
.in +5

A 0 indicates success, a -1 indicates failure.

(stat = 18)

stat; name; buf


.in -5
.bd
RETURNS
.in +5
.br
The carry flag is cleared on success, or set on failure.
On success, the status is placed in the 36-byte area
pointed at by buf.
