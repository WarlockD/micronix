FUNCTION       
.in +5
.br
.bd
Mount
informs the system that the given
block device contains a file system.
Subsequent references to the file "on"
will refer to the root directory of the
new file system. The old contents of "on"
are inaccessible until the device is
unmounted.

If ronly is non-zero, the system will not
allow writing on the device. If the device
is physically write protected, it should
still be mounted read-only to prevent
the system from trying to update access times.

This call is restricted to the super-user.
There is a limit to the number of devices
that can be mounted concurrently.
