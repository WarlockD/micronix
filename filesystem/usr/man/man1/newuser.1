FUNCTION   
.in +5
.br
.bd
Newuser 
is largely interactive and fairly self-explanatory.

A menu-type display will ask you for the new user name
and for the name of a group to put him in.
It makes a directory for the new user, setting the owner and
group properly, makes a new entry in the "/etc/passwd" file and
possibly makes a new entry in the "/etc/group" file.
.sp
.bd
Newuser 
is intended to make it easy to add new users.
You may want to customize your "/etc/passwd" file, however.
.bd
Newuser 
utilizes locking, so that two newusers running
simultaneously will not interfere with each other.

FILES
/etc/passwd
/etc/group
