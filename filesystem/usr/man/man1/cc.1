FUNCTION

.br
.bd
Cc
is the Whitesmiths' C compiler supervisor; it accepts several 
types of arguments:

Those ending with ".p" are assumed to be Pascal source files and
are converted to ".c" files.
Arguments ending with ".c" are taken to be C source files and
are compiled with each relocatable object module left in the file
named for the source with ".o" substituted for ".c".

In the same way, arguments whose names end with ".s" are taken to be
A-natural source files and are compiled to produce an ".o" file.

The following options are meaningful to 
.bd
cc:

.in +10
.ta 10
.ti -10
-c	Suppress the loading phase of the compilation, and force 
object file(s) to be produced for each source file.

.ti -10
-i name	Passed on to 
.bd
cpp, 
the C compiler preprocessor. Name
is a prefix to be used on "# include <files>".

.ti -10
-o file	The result of the compilation will be written on the named file.
If no "-o" option is given, the output is written to "a.out"

.ti -10
-lX	Library inclusion.  The file "/lib/libX.a" will be included in
the linking phase of the compilation.  An example is included below.

.ti -10
-lS	Use the standard I/O library.  Note that this only affects the
loading phase of the compilation.  If you use the library, your programs
should include the line:
.sp
.ce
.bd
# include <stdio.h>
.sp 2
.ti -10
-cpm	Compile to run under CP/M.

.ti -10
-ws	Use the Whitesmiths' C library.
.bp
.ti -10
-xN	where N is a number.  Arguments of this type are passed on to
pass 2 of the compiler; see 
.bd
cp2.
