DESCRIPTION
.br
The CP/M diskette that comes with Micronix includes the following
bootstrap programs:

.in +8
.ti -8
djboot	Boot from the DJDMA controller
with a 5 inch or an 8 inch drive.

.ti -8
hdboot	Boot from the HDCA controller
the 10, 20, or 26 megabyte drive

.ti -8
m5boot	Boot from the HDDMA controller
with the 5 megabyte drive

.ti -8
m10boot	Boot from the HDDMA controller
with the 10 megabyte drive

.ti -8
m16boot	Boot from the HDDMA controller
with the 16 megabyte drive
.in -8

These are CP/M programs, ie, they are stored on the CP/M
diskette as djboot.com, hdboot.com, etc, and are invoked
from CP/M by typing the name without the .com extension.

In each case, they assume that the target disk contains
a Micronix file system, and they search its root
directory for files that could be Micronix kernels.
If exactly one such file is found, it is loaded and
executed. If more than one kernel
is found, the names are listed and the operator is asked
choose one. This allows backup copies or alternate
versions to be kept.

CP/M's only role in this process is the invocation of
the bootstrap program. Once the bootstrap begins
executing, it is independent of CP/M, and CP/M itself
is overwritten as Micronix is loaded.

CP/M can be eliminated entirely by placing the desired
bootstrap program on the "system tracks" of a floppy disk.
Then as long as that diskette is in drive A, Micronix will
boot automatically from the appropriate hard disk
every time the Decision's RESET button is hit. This
should save the operator about 5 seconds per day.
(CAUTION: if Micronix is already running, make
sure you type sync before hitting RESET.)

The loaders that can be placed on a floppy's system tracks
are stored as files on the Micronix CP/M diskette,
and are called hdload, m5load, m10load, and m16load,
corresponding to the similarly-named bootstrap programs.
See below for an installation example.
The djboot program has already been placed on the
system tracks of the Micronix stand-alone floppy,
so if you put this in drive A and hit RESET, it
will boot automatically.

BUGS

.fi
The bootstrap programs only search the first block
of the root directory, so you should limit your
root directory to 32 entries (which is a good idea
anyway, to speed up rooted file-name searches),
or else you should make sure that the Micronix
kernel occurs as one of the first 32 entries.
