FUNCTION
.in +5
.br
.bd
Ls
lists all the named non-directories first, then the contents
of each named directory.
If no names are specified, the current directory is listed.

There are three basic printing formats: line, multi-column, and
long.

Line format is one file to a line.

In multi-column format, 
.bd
ls 
produces a rectangular array
of file names sorted down the page and compacted as much as
possible within an 80 column width.

In long format, files are listed one to a line with a lot
of information about each file packed into the line
(see -l below).

Long format is explicitly forced by the -l or -g option (see below).
Otherwise, 
.bd
ls 
chooses line or multi-cloumn format
automatically, depending on whether its standard output
is a file or a terminal.

Options:

.ta 5
.in +5
.ti -5
.bd
-a	All.
.bd
Normally, files names beginning with '.' are not listed.
If -a is specified, they are listed.

.ti -5
.bd
-d	Directory.
Normally, if a directory name is given, its contents is listed.
If -d is specified, then only the name is printed (along with
any other attributes called for by other options).

.ti -5
.bd
-f	File order.
Disable all sorting and print the files in the order they
actually appear in the directory.

.ti -5
.bd
-g	Group.
For each file, print the name of the owner's group,
instead of the owner's login name.
The latter is the default for long listings.
(This option forces a long listing, whether or not
-l has been specified.)

.ti -5
-i	Print the inode number of each file.
.bp
.ti -5
.bd
-l	Long format.
Print mode, link count, owner, size,
time of last modification, and name.

.ti -5
.bd
-r	Reverse.
Files are sorted in reverse order.

.ti -5
.bd
-s	Sizes are given in blocks (of 512 bytes each)
instead of characters.

.ti -5
.bd
-t	Time sort.
Sort files by modification time (most recent first)
instead of alphabetically.

.ti -5
.bd
-u	Use the access time instead of the
modification time for -t and -l.
.sp 2

Long printing format is laid out as follows:

Each line refers to one file.
The fields printed are:
.sp
.bd
.ce
mode  links  owner  size  time   name
.sp
Mode is the access permissions of the file symbolically displayed.

Links is the number of links to the file.

Owner is the login name of the user who owns the file.

Size is the size of the file in bytes (or blocks with the -s option)

Time is the last modification time (or last access time) of the file.


The mode takes the form:
.sp 
.ce
.bd
-[bcd]rwxrwxrwx
.sp
The
.bd
- 
stands for plain file or permission not granted; the
.sp
.nf
	b stands for block special file
	c stands for character special file
	d stands for directory
.sp
.fi
Files may also have the following characters interspersed within
these descriptions:
.sp
.nf
	l stands for write locked file
	s stands for set user or group ID on execution
	r stands for read permission
	w stands for write permission
	x stands for execute permission
.sp
.fi
If a letter is missing in the above representation,
it indicates that permission for that mode of access is not permitted.
.sp

.bd
EXAMPLES
.in +5
.br
.ti +8
.bd
drwxr-xr-x

The 
.bd
d 
means this is a directory.

The 
.bd
rwx 
means the owner of the directory has all permissions.

The
.bd
r-x 
means those user's in the directory's group have only read and search
permission on the directory.
Likewise for others (those users who are neither the owner of the
directory nor in the same group).
.sp 2
.ti +8
.bd
-rl-r--r--
.sp
.bd
- 
means this is a plain file.
.sp
.bd
rl- 
means the file is readable by the owner and write locked.
.sp
.bd
r-- 
means the file is readable by those in the group.

the second 
.bd
r-- 
means the file is readable by anyone else on the system also.
