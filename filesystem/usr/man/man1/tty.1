.bd
DESCRIPTION
.in +5
.br
.bd
Tty 
is a simple program that attempts to look
up the full path name and number of the current "tty" device 
(teletypewriter or terminal).
Normally, this is the name of the Micronix (terminal) port you
logged in on.

To ascertain your device number, enter the 
.bd
tty
command.
A typical response is
.sp
.ti +5
/dev/ttyB
.sp
meaning that you are on "ttyB".

If no associated file name can be found, the message "not a tty"
is printed instead.
