ddt 
- a program for examination and manipulation of 
.nf
      non-text files

.sp 2

SYNOPSIS
.in +5
.br
ddt [file]
.sp 2
.in -5
.bd
FUNCTION    
.in +5
.br
.bd
Ddt 
can be a handy tool for programmers and others 
who need to manipulate arbitrary (i.e. non-ASCII text) files.

It is functionally analogous to CP/M's DDT, 
but the Digital Research version works with memory, while this one
works on files.

Changes made to a file under 
.bd
ddt 
are immediately effective.
There is no intermediate buffer as with some editors.

Addresses (mentioned below)
are given in hexadecimal, (up to six digits long).
If the first character of an address is an 
.bd
' 
(apostrophe), the value of that number will be that of the ASCII character following.


The following are valid addresses:
.sp
.nf
.bd 2
0	6	b	B	'y	
c3b0 	78ba4  'A      FFFF	'/
.sp
.fi
Address list may be comma-separated or space-separated.

The following are valid address lists:
.sp
.nf
.bd
0,ffff	0,5,7	0,3000,'a	'a,'b,'c
.sp
.fi
No command takes more than three addresses.
Extra addresses are ignored.
.sp
.bd
Ddt 
always remembers the last file address accessed.
In most cases, if you give no address on the next
command, this old remembered address is used.
.bp
Commands:
.sp 
.ti -3
.bd
d - display
.sp
Takes 0, 1, or 2 arguments.
Displays the contents of the file in hex
bytes on the left
and ASCII characters on the right.
If no address follows 
.bd
d, 
the next 128 bytes, starting at the given
location, are displayed.

Finally, if two addresses are given, that part of the file
which lies between the two addresses is
displayed.

Examples:
.nf
.sp
.bd
	d 0, ffff
.sp
.bd
	d
.sp
.bd
	d 55
.sp
.bd
	d a000
.sp 2
.fi
.ti -3
.bd
f - fill (requires three arguments)
.sp
.ti -3
.bd
f A, B, C
.sp
The portion of the file which
lies between addresses A and B (inclusive)
is overwritten with a flood of the character C.
.sp
If C is large, then the low order byte of C is used.

Example:
.nf
.sp
.bd
	f 0, 3000, e5
.fi
.sp
writes E5s from 0 to 3000 hex.
.sp 2
.ti -3
.bd
r filename (Read)
.sp
The file on which ddt is operating is changed to filename if possible.
.nf
Examples:

	r new
	r /usrsrc/cmd/pbx.c
	r /etc/dtab
	r a/b
.sp 2
.fi
.ti -3
.bd
s (address) Substitute
.sp
Takes 0 or 1 arguments.  if no argument is given, the currently remembered file address is used.
the 
.bd
substitute
command allows you to examine and optionally change the file on a 
byte-by-byte basis.
After entering the 
.bd
substitute 
command you will be in "substitute" mode
until you exit
it by entering a single period on
a line.
If while in the substitute mode you press RETURN,
the byte you were looking at will remain unchanged
and you will be stepped to the next byte.
If you enter a byte value and then push RETURN,
the byte will be changed to the byte entered.
.sp 2
.in -3
.bd
/ (address)
.br
.bd
// (search)
.sp
.in +3
.bd
Ddt 
has the ability to search for patterns in a file.
When the "/" command is given, you will be asked to enter a 
series of bytes to search for.
If an address follows the "/", the search commences at the given
address in the file.
Without an address, the search commences at the current file address.

The "//" command is a shorthand to search again for the previously
given pattern.
