.br
The first named file is copied to the second.

If the last named file is a directory, 
each of the preceding named files are copied "into the directory".

.bd
Cp
refuses to copy a file to itself or with the directory as
source.  That is, "file" is copied to "dir/file".

.bd
Cp,
as a command under Micronix, is analogous (but not identical)
to PIP under CP/M.  It is the most common and efficient way to copy files.
