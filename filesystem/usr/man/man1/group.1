FUNCTION    
.in +5
.br
Associated with each Micronix file is a group number.
The group number is used to determine group access permission.
If you are running a single user, informal, or very low
user-population system, the whole concept of groups
may be irrelevant to you.

The 
.bd
group
command can be used to view the group names of files.
The relationship of group names to group numbers is entirely
established by the file "/etc/group" [see 
.bd
group 
(5)].
.sp
.bd
Group 
prints the group name for each file given.
If the file's group number has no name, the group number is printed in
decimal instead.

If the first argument to 
.bd
group 
is a group name preceded by a hyphen,
.bd
group 
attempts to change 
the group of each of the named files to the given name.
