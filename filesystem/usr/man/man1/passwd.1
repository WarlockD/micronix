Passwd
is used to
changed the login password of the given user.

When a user's account is first created,
it has no password, that is, no password will be demanded of
the user at log in time.

This command may be used set or change your password.
The super user may set or change anyone's password, but,
not even the super user may know what a user's password is.
It may, however, be changed to something known.

This program is fairly self-explanatory and
prompts you for the name of the user whose password
you want to change and the password itself.
When you type the password, the "echo" is temporarily
turned off, so that the password is unseen.
Only the encryption of the password is kept around.
If two or more users set their password to the same thing,
the encryptions will not be the same.

that passwords be long, complicated, fast to type, and frequently changed.
