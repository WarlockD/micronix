FUNCTION   
.in +5
.br
.bd
Mkfs 
builds an empty file system on the named device.
If no size is specified, it determines the device size
automatically. A numerical argument 
.ul
without 
a leading
"-" is taken as the desired size
(in 512-byte blocks).
A numerical argument
.ul
with 
a leading "-" is taken as a number of blocks to
be excluded from the file system at the end of the
device (say for swap space). In this case, the actual
device size is also determined automatically.

The 
.bd
ilist 
size is set to 
.sp
.ce
.bd
s/43 + s/1000, 
.sp
where 
.bd
s 
is the file system size determined above.
The smallest practical file system is about 50 blocks.

.bd
Warning!
Extreme care should be taken when using this command: It
.ul
obliterates
any former file system on the device.  If, for example, you entered
.sp
.ce
.bd
mkfs /dev/root
.sp
you would have to rebuild your files from scratch.  Needless to say,
aim carefully!
