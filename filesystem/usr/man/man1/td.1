FUNCTION   
.in +5
.br
.bd
Td 
provides reasonably convenient back-up service.
.sp
.bd
Td 
dumps potentially all the files in the named
directory and in all of its sub-directories recursively.
.sp
.bd
Td 
is intended to provide the facility to save
files on floppy diskettes (although it can be used in other ways).

It doesn't matter if your dump won't all fit on one floppy diskette;
.bd
td 
allows you to change diskettes on the fly.
Each disk is filled to capacity, then the program asks
for operator service.
In this sense it does need a bit of babysitting.
.sp 
.bd
Td 
incorporates the facility to do incremental dumps.
That is, each new back up contains only files which have
changed since the last incremental dump.
It uses a system-wide dump table to remember the times
directories were dumped.

Before beginning a major dump,
you should have a stack of formatted
diskettes.
These diskettes must be pre-formatted
but they need not contain file systems.
.bd
Td 
will notice that a diskette has no file system
and ask you if it should make one.
It will then call the 
.bd
mkfs 
program for you.

Unlike some other back-up systems, this program's back-ups are in 
file system
form, meaning it is easy to look through
a dump.

Options:
.sp 2

-dN	Day. Dump only files newer than N days old.
.sp
.ti -5
-hN	Hour.  Dump only files newer than N hours old. Note: The -d 
and -h options are additive.
.bp
.ti -5
-i	Incremental.  Dump files changed since the last dump of 
the directory.
.sp
.ti -5
-u	Update.  Update the central dump table at the conclusion
