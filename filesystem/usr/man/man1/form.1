DESCRIPTION
.in +5
.fi
.bd
Form
is a general purpose text formatter with text filling, underline,
indenting, centering, and other useful capabilities.
This document was prepared using 
.bd
form.
.sp
The standard input is read and formatted according to instructions
embedded in the input file; the result is written to the standard output.

If a list of files names is given, they are used as the input.
If "-o" followed by a file name appears on the command line,
then the output is written into the named file.

If "-t" appears on the command line, then the output
is made more suitable for a glass tty, i.e. long sequences of
blank lines are avoided.
.sp
Input consists of text lines interspersed with command lines 
destined to be printed

If the first character of a line is a period (.), 
.bd
form 
attempts to interpret the line as a command; in any 
case, the text of such lines will not appear verbatim in the output.
.sp
The following commands are implemented:
.sp 2
.bd
 .bd n

Cause the next (or number of given) line(s) of text to be double-striked
for bold face appearance. (Default is 1.)  Printer must have double-strike
ability, otherwise
.bd
overstrike
(Section 1) must be implemented.


.bd
 .bp n

Begin page number n.
Jump to the top of the next page.
Set the page number to n (default is sequential order beginning with 1).
.sp 2
.bd
 .br

Cause break.
The next input line will begin at the left margin.
.bp
.bd
 .ce n

Center the next (or number of given) input line(s).  Default is 
next line only.
.sp 2
.bd
 .fi

Set filled text mode.
All text lines will be filled out with blanks if necessary
so that the right margin is justified.
Fill mode is the initial default condition.
.sp 2
.bd
 .fo TEXT

Set the footer.
The specified text will be printed at the bottom of each page.
.sp 2
.bd
 .he TEXT

Set the header.
The specified text will be printed at the top of each
following page.
.sp 2
.bd
 .in n

Set the indent.
The indent is set to the nth column.  The command ".in 0" is 
interpreted to mean no indent. Default is 0.
.sp 2
.bd
 .ls n

Set the line spacing to n lines.  The command
".ls 2" is interpreted  to mean double space.
The line spacing is set to 1 (default) initially.
.sp 2
.bd
 .nf

No fill.  Turns off fill mode; lines are no longer justified.
.sp 2
.bd
 .pl n

Page length.  
The page length is set to n lines long.
If no number (n) is specified, the page length is set to 66 lines (default).
.bp
.bd
 .rm n

Right margin. 
The right margin is set at column n.
If no number (n) is specified, it is set at column 60 (default).
.sp 2
.bd
 .sp n

Space down n lines.
If no number (n) is given, spaces 1 line (default).
.sp 2
.bd
 .ta n

Set the tab.  Value (n) determines amount of tabbed spaces.  Entered with
^I sequence or TAB key. When used with next (.ti) command, produces 
"hanging" paragraphs.


.bd
 .ti n

Temporary indent.
The indent is set to a value (n) for the next line only.
This is quite useful for numbering paragraphs - a negative value produces a
"hanging" paragraph.
.sp 2
.bd
 .ul n

Cause the next (or number of given) input line(s) to be underlined.
The default is 1.  Printer must have double-strike capability. If not,
see the
