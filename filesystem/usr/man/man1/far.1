FUNCTION
.in +5
.br
.bd
Far
provides a simple interface to CP/M floppy diskettes.
Device is
assumed to be
the name of a Micronix special file
(such as /dev/fla)
containing a CP/M diskette.
Names such as /dev/fla may be abbreviated as fla.

The flags are:

.ta 10
.in +10
.ti -10
.bd
-d	Delete.  
Delete the named files from the floppy diskette.
If no file names are given, no action is taken.

.ti -10
.bd
-p	Print.
Each named file is sent to the standard output.	

.ti -10
.bd
-r	Replace.
Each named file is copied
.ul
to
the floppy.
If no file names are given, no action is taken.
If a file already exists on the floppy, it is
silently overwritten.

.ti -10
.bd
-t	Table.
Print a table of contents of the floppy diskette.
If any files are named, only those named and present are listed.

.ti -10
.bd
-x	Extract.
Each named file is copied 
.ul
from
the diskette
.ul
to
the current Micronix directory.
If no file names are given, 
.ul
the entire contents
of the diskette
is extracted.

.ti -10
.bd
-v	Verbose.
Be verbose about it.
Each operation is printed along with the affected file name.
Files deleted are preceded by a "d", 
those replaced are preceded by an "r",
those extracted are preceded by "x".

.in -10
At most, one of the flags -
.bd
d, t, r, x 
- may be present.
If none are present, 
.bd
-t 
is assumed.

The file list may contain wild card matching patterns
to be applied to the set of file names in the CP/M
diskette's directory.

The rules for file name matching patterns are
exactly the same as those for the shell (see sh (I)).

EXAMPLES
.br
.in +5
You receive a new CP/M software package in the mail on diskette
and want to run it under Micronix.
.sp 2
To copy its contents to Micronix,
insert the diskette into floppy drive A and
type:

.ce
.bd	
far fla -xv

To copy a file from a diskette, changing its name in the process:

.ce
.bd
far dja -p filename > newname


To copy only the ".doc" files over from a CP/M mini-floppy:

.ce
.bd
far mfa -xv "*.doc"
