FUNCTION
.in +5
.br
.bd
Anat
translates A-Natural narrative assembly language for the Intel 8080
to standard assembly language acceptable for either the ISIS-II 
asm80 or the Microsoft Macro-80 assembler.  Since the output of 
the 8080 code generator, 
.bd
p2, 
is A-natural, 
.bd
anat 
is required to interface the C compiler to
existing 8080 software development facilities.

The flags are:
.sp
.in +10
.ta 10
.ti -10
-i	Emit code in ISIS-II format.  Identifiers have each
"." changed to "@" and each "_" changed to "?".  Default is
Microsoft, in which case each "." is changed to "$" and each
"_" is changed to ".".
.sp
.ti -10
-o	Filename can be specified with the -o operand so that the 
output is written to
the specified file and an error message is written to STDOUT.  Default
is STDOUT for output and STDERR for error message.
.sp
.ti -10
-s	Emit an end statement.  With a start operand, specifies
a starting address.  Default is no start address on the end statement.
.sp 2
.in -10
If <files> are present, they are concatenated in order and used as the 
input file instead of the default STDIN.

If -o is absent, one or more files are present and the first filename
begins with "8", 
.bd
as 
then behaves is if 
.bd
-o 
was specified using the first
filename, except that the trailing "8" is changed to "m". Thus,

.ce
.bd
anat file.8
.sp
is the same as

.ce
.bd
anat -o file.m file.8
.sp
If 
.bd
-o 
is present, a name directive (title for Microsoft) is emitted using
the output file name as the module name; any ".suffix" in the name is stripped
off.  If there is no 
.bd
-o, 
but <files> are present, the first input
file name is used in the name directive.  If neither is preset, no name
directive is emitted.

Code generation begins in 
.bd
cseg, 
and reverts to 
.bd
cseg 
at the end before any
literals are emitted.  Any symbols not defined by the end of the input
file are published via extrn statements at the end.

The start string used with 
.bd
-s 
does not have "." and "_" mapped as identifiers.
