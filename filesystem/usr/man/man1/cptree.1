FUNCTION         
.in +5
.br
The contents of the source directory and all its descendants
are copied into the destination directory.

The destination directory must exist, but 
.bd
cptree 
will create any needed sub-directories.

If either the source or destination names are not given, 
.bd
cptree 
will ask for them.

If 
.bd
-v 
is in the command line, 
.bd
cptree 
will print each operation
in the tree copy as it is performed.

It is permissible to copy a tree into a sub-tree of itself.
.bd
Cptree 
will avoid getting into a wormhole.
