FUNCTION

.fi
.bd
Expand
reverses the effects of

compress.
.bd
Expand
is not guaranteed to do anything sensible with input
which is not the result of a 
.bd
compress 
run. The first named file is expanded and written into the second named file.
If no file names are given, standard input and output are used.
If only one file name is given, the named file is used for input,
and its expansion is written to the standard output.
