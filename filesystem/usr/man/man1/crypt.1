FUNCTION   
.in +5
.br
.bd
Crypt 
reads from its standard input and writes to its standard output,
encrypting as it goes, according to the key.
.bd
Crypt 
is its own inverse; to read an encrypted file, all you need
to know is the key word.

Note:
this is not a very sophisticated encryption scheme
(NSA would have it overnight).

You can increase the complexity of the encryption by
using multiple passes of 
.bd
crypt, 
each with a different keyword.

.br
To encrypt a file:
.sp

	crypt bandersnatch < file > encrypted
.sp
.fi
To read the encrypted file
.sp
.nf
.bd
	crypt bandersnatch < encrypted
.sp
.fi
Encrypt a file with three keywords:
.sp
