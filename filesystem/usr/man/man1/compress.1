USAGE        
.in +5
.br
.bd
compress [ input [ output ] ]

FUNCTION
.in +5
.br
The first named file is compressed and written onto the second named file.
If no file names are given, the standard input and output are used.
If only one file name is given, the named file is used for input
and its compression
is written to the standard output.
If the second named file does not exist, it is created.
.sp
.bd
Compress
searches for opportunities to abbreviate long runs
of identical characters in an input stream.
It encodes these into a form that the 
.bd
expand 
program
can later be used to undo.
The remainder of the file is merely copied through.
Most text files are probably not worth compressing
unless they contain long runs of spaces.
Data files, such as executable modules,
benefit somewhat from compression.
A typical compression value is 7%.

EXAMPLE
.in +5
.br
To compress a file (for disk file space saving):
.sp
.in +8
.bd
compress input compressed
.in -8
 

.in -5
.bd
NOTES
.in +5
.br
Due to I/O idiosyncracies on some systems, the
standard input and output cannot be used.
The automatic addition of carriage returns, etc. in the
input and output streams is unacceptable for this program.
The construction
.sp
.in +8
.bd
compress input output
.sp
.in -8
should work regardless of the local environment.
