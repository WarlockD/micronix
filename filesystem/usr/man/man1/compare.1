FUNCTION
.in +5
.br
.bd
Compare
reads the two named files, line by line, and announces
any differing lines, including the line number.
.sp 2

.bd
EXAMPLE
.in +5
.br
To find the differing line in two nearly identical files:
.sp
.ce
.bd
compare version1 version2
.sp 2
.in -5
.bd
NOTES
.in +5
.br
The algorithm is very poor if lines have been
added or deleted to one of the files.
Compare will then report that all of the
following lines differ when in fact only
a small change may have been made
between the two files.
