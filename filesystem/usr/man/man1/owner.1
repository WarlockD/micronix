FUNCTION   
.in +5
.br
Every Micronix file has associated with it a user I.D. number -
the "owner" of the file.

The 
.bd
owner 
utility program allows you to examine or change
this file owner number.
.bd 
NOTE:
Only the super-user may change the owner of a file.

There is usually a name for each user I.D. number.
These names are kept in the system-wide file "/etc/passwd."

In order to discover who owns a file, type:
.sp
.ti +5
.bd
owner filename
.sp 
The program will look up the owner of the file
and attempt to express it as a user name.
If this is not possible, it will list the owner as a
numerical user I.D.
.sp 2
To change the owner of a file, type
.sp
.ti +5
.bd
owner -newowner filename
.sp
.bd
newowner 
may be a user name or a user I.D. number (names are recommended).

The 
.bd
owner 
program works equally well with list of files:
.sp
.ti +5
.bd
owner file1 file2 file3 file4 file5

reports on the ownership of each of the named files.
