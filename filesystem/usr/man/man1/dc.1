FUNCTION      
.br
.in +5
.bd
Dc
is a stack-oriented desk calculator allowing integer arithmetic
and conversion.
Its operation is much like a Reverse Polish Notation calculator.
It reads the standard input and writes the standard output.
Each token is processed as soon as it is read;
.bd
? 
is the only error diagnostic.
The following is a list of the tokens, their meanings, 
and the action 
.bd
dc 
will take.

.bd
<number>
.sp
.in +5
A number.
The number is pushed on the stack, (i.e., remembered).
A number must begin with a digit or a minus sign followed by a digit.
For example, to input ten in base sixteen, type 
.bd
0a.
.sp 2
.in -5
.bd
'<character>
.sp 
.in +5
An apostrophe followed by a character is converted to 
that character's
ASCII value and pushed onto the stack.
.sp 2
.in -5
.bd
+, -, *, /, %, &, |, ^, <, >
.sp
.in +5
These are the binary operators.
The top two values on the stack are combined.
Division by zero is not permitted.
If a binary operation is attempted with fewer than two numbers
in the stack, an error will result.
.sp
The following are the operators and their meanings.

.nf
.in +3
.bd 10
+	add
-	subtract
*	multiply
/	divide
%	modulo
&	bitwise and
|	bitwise or
^	bitwise exclusive or
<	bitwise shift left
>	bitwise shift right

.in -8
.fi
.sp
.in +10
.ta 10
.ti -10
~	The top value on the stack is bitwise inverted.
It is an error for the stack to be empty.
.sp
.ti -10
i	Set the input radix.
The input radix is set to the value on the top of the stack.
Values less than 2 are not accepted.
Values larger than 36 are liable to cause garbage.
All further input is assumed to be in the new radix.
.sp
.ti -10
o	Set the output radix, as above.
.sp
.ti -10
p	Print the value on the top of the stack.
.sp
.ti -10
c	Clear.  The stack is emptied.
