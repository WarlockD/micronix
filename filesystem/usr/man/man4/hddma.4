FUNCTION
.in +5
.br
The HDDMA controls up to four 5 1/4 inch Winchester disk drives.
Micronix currently supports 3 drive sizes:

.in +5
.nf
m5      5 megabytes
m10     10 megabytes
m16     16 megabytes
.in -5
.fi

The device names (in the /dev directory) for these disks
depend on their position on the HDDMA daisy-chain.
An m5 attached as drive A is called "m5a", an m16 attached
as drive D is called "m16d", etc.
The major/minor device numbers are as follows:

.in +5
.nf
3/0  m5a        3/4  m10a       3/8  m16a
3/1  m5b        3/5  m10b       3/9  m16b
3/2  m5c        3/6  m10c       3/10 m16c
3/3  m5d        3/7  m10d       3/11 m16d

.fi

Micronix does not support a disk formatting program, so each
drive must be formatted under CP/M. A sector skew of 6 is
recommended, but is not critical. Since these drives are
soft-sectored, there is no compatibility problem with
different skews.

If you ever have to explore the surface of one
of these drives without the intervention of Micronix,
you should know that Micronix logically "rolls" the tracks
by (number of tracks) / 2. Thus on an m5, which has 153
tracks, logical track 0 is physical track 76.
The reason for this is that most Micronix systems have
only one hard disk, which must serve as both the root
device and the swap device. When Micronix sees that
rootdev == swapdev, it uses the space above the file
system as swap space. Thus, the logical disk looks like:

.in +5
.nf
 ilist           file space             swap space
|-------|-----------------------------|------------|

.ti -5
while the physical disk looks like:

 file space   swap space   ilist     file space
------------|------------|-------|-----------------
.in -5
.fi

In a busy system, the disk heads spend most of their time
over the swap space and the ilist, so this gives a
performance advantage.
