A core file is produced by the system as a result of certain fatal signals;
the offending program is then terminated.
The file produced is named "core" in the current directory of the
dumped program at the time of the fatal signal.  The format of the
core dump file is as follows:

The first 65,536 bytes are simply a "snapshot" of the program as it
appeared in memory at the critical instant.  Following this "memory image"
is certain other pertinent information, mostly the contents of the
Z80's registers:
