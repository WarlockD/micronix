FUNCTION   
.in +5
.br
The 
.bd
ttys 
file is read by the 
.bd
init 
program and specifies which typewriter special
files are to have a process created for them which will allow
users to log in.
There is one line in the file for each typewriter.
It is good practice to maintain entries for all typewriters in the system,
including those that are turned off.

The format of each line of the 
.bd
ttys 
file may be entered free-form,
i.e., in any order, with any amount of spaces between the specifiers.

Four specifiers may be entered; only one is really required, though.
Let's take a sample line from a 
.bd
ttys 
file.
.sp 
.ti +5
.bd
ttyA	9600	on	shake
.sp
The device name (ttyA in this example) 
.ul
must 
appear on the line.

If no baud rate is given, the default baud rate of 9600 is used.

If no "on" or "off" specifier is given, by default the port will be on.

If no "shake" specifier is given, hardware handshaking will not be used.
(In most cases, the "shake" option is not used and should not
be specified.
It is required only for some slow printers and terminals.)

In the above example, ttyA is active (on) and set at 9600 baud with
hardware handshaking.  It is possible, however to set up three terminals
that run at 9600 baud and that do not require hardware handshaking as
follows:
.sp
.nf
	ttyA
	ttyB
	ttyC
