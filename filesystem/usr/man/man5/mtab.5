FUNCTION   
.in +5
.br
.bd
Mtab 
resides in the /etc directory and contains a table of devices
"mounted" by the 
.bd
mount 
command.  The 
.bd
umount 
command removes entries.

Each entry is 64 bytes long.
The first 32 bytes are the null padded name of the place where the
special file is mounted;
the second 32 are the null padded name of the special file.
The special file has all its directories stripped away,
that is, everything through the last '/' is thrown away.

This table is present only so people can look at it.
It does not matter to 
.bd
mount 
if there are
duplicate entries, nor to 
.bd
umount 
if a name cannot be found.
