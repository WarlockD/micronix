FUNCTION   
.in +5
.br
The 
.bd
init 
(initialization) program looks for the "/etc/rc" file just before 
entering the multi-user mode.
If such a file is found, and is readable,
it is run as a shell script.
That is, each of the commands in the file is executed as if from 
the keyboard.

Typically, it is used to clean out the temporary directory, 
remove locked files, start up daemons, etc.  The user may place
whatever he desires in the file.
