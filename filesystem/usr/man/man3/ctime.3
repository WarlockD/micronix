FUNCTION   
.in +5
.br
.bd
Ctime
converts a time pointed to by 
.bd
clock
[as returned by 
.bd
time
(2)] 
into ASCII.  It returns a pointer to a 26-character string in the
following form:
.sp 2
.ce
.bd
Wed Mar 10 12:12:59 1982\n\0
.sp
All fields have constant width.
.sp 2
.bd
Localtime
and
.bd
gmtime
return pointers to structures containing the broken-down time.

.bd
Localtime
corrects for the time zone and daylight savings time, if necessary.

.bd
Gmtime 
converts to Greenwich Mean Time - the time that Micronix uses.

.bd
Asctime 
converts broken-down time to ASCII and returns a 26-character string.
.sp
The 
.bd
include
file structure declaration follows:
.bp
.nf
.in +8
.bd 11
struct tm { /* see ctime(3) */
	int	tm_sec;
	int	tm_min;
	int	tm_hour
	int	tm_mday;
	int	tm_mon;
	int	tm_year;
	int	tm_wday;
	int	tm_yday;
	int	tm_isdst;
};

The time is given using the following elements:
.sp
.in +8
- 24 hour clock
.br
- day of month, 1-31 days per month
.br
- month of year, numbered 0-11
.br
- day of the week, numbered 0-6
.br
- date of the year, beginning 1900 - 
.br
- day of the year, 0-365
.br
- non-zero flag indicates daylight savings 
.sp 2
.in -8
The program checks the system to determine if time zone and/or
daylight savings time adjustments are appropriate whenever the 
local time is called for.  (Adjustments for changes in these conversions
in 1974 and 1975 are included.)

.bd
Timezone 
returns the time zone, measured in minutes westward from
Greenwich, associated with its first argument.  If the second argument
is 0, the standard name is used.  A non-zero flag indicates daylight
savings time.

A table is built into the routine.  If the required name does not
appear on this table, the difference from GMT is produced.  
In Afghanistan, for example:
.sp
.ce
.bd
timezone(-60*4+30), 0)
.sp
would be appropriate because it is eastward of GMT +4:30.  The string
.bd
GMT+4:30
is produced.
