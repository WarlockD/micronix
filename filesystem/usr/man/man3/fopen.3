FUNCTION   
.in +5
.br
.bd
Fopen
opens the file specified by "filename" and associates it with a stream. 
It returns a pointer to be used to identify the stream in subsequent
operations.
.sp
.bd
Type
is a character containing one of the following values:
.sp
.in +8
.bd
a
- append; begin new writing, or begin at end 
.nf
    of current writing.
.sp
.fi
.bd
r
- open for reading
.sp
.bd
w
- create for writing
.sp 2
.in -8
.bd
Freopen
substitutes the named file in place of an open stream; it returns the
original value of
.bd
stream.  
The original value of 
.bd
stream
is closed.  This routine may also be used to attach preopened constant
names -
.bd
stdin, stdout, stderr,
- to specified files.

.bd
Fdopen
associates a stream with a file descriptor obtained from
.bd
creat, dup, open
or
.bd
pipe 
(see section 2). The 
.bd
type
of the stream must agree with the mode of the open file.

If
.bd
filename
cannot be accessed,
.bd
fopen
and
.bd

return the NULL pointer.
