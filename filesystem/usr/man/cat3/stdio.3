          This   section   describes   two   levels  of  buffered
          input/output utilities: 1) in-line macros designated by
          (3),  and  2)  higher  level  standard  I/O   utilities
          designated by (3s) or (3m).
          
          The  in-line  macros,  ggeettcc  and ppuuttcc handle characters
          quickly.
          
          Routines such as ggeettss,, ffggeettss,, pprriinnttff,, ffpprriinnttff,,  ffwwrriittee,,
          ffrreeaadd,,  ppuuttss  and  ssccaannff  and  ffssccaannff  use  the in-line
          macros; both levels may be freely intermixed.
          
          Files with this type of associated buffering are called
          ssttrreeaammss and are declared to be a pointer to  a  defined
          type   FFIILLEE..  FFooppeenn  (3)  has  the  ability  to  create
          descriptive data for streams. It returns a  pointer  to
          designate  the  stream  in  all  further  transactions.
          Normally, there are three open  streams  with  constant
          pointers declared in the iinncclluuddee file associated with a
          standard open file:

              ssttddiinn - standard input file
              ssttddoouutt - standard output file
              ssttddeerrrr - standard error file


          A constant "pointer" (NULL 0) designates no stream.

          An  integer  constant  (end  of  file,  or  EOF  -1) is
          returned upon error by any integer functions that  deal
          with streams or upon end of file.
          
          Routines  that use the I/O package must have the header
          file with the pertinent macro definitions  (<stdio.h>).
          The  iinncclluuddee  file declares all functions and constants
          described in the sections designated by (3s); they need
          no further declaration.

          The following  constants  and  functions  are  used  as
          macros:

                  ffeeooff ffeerrrroorr ffiilleennoo ggeettcc ggeettcchhaarr ppuuttcc

          It is dangerous to redeclare these names.


     EERRRROORRSS
          The EEOOFF value is consistently returned, indicating that
          a  FFIILLEE  pointer  has  not been initialized with ffooppeenn..
          This means that input or output has been  attempted  on
          an  output  or  input  stream,  or  that a FFIILLEE pointer
          designates corrupt FFIILLEE data.
          
          This use of the standard library has  been  changed  to
          line  buffer  output  to  a  terminal  by  default.  It
          attempts to flush  the  output  whenever  a  rreeaadd  (see
          Section  2)  from  the  standard input is necessary. In
          most cases, this makes the utility more efficient.  The
          actions  themselves  should be transparent unless it is
          used with programs which use standard I/O routines  _a_n_d
          rreeaadd (2) to read from the standard input.
          
          When  large  amounts  of  computation  are  done  after
          outputting  part  of  a  line  to  a  terminal,  it  is
          necessary  to  fffflluusshh  (3)  the  standard output before
          continuing on so that the output appears.
