          SSyysstteemm  causes  ssttrriinngg  to  be given to sshh (see shell -
          Section 1) as input just as  if  the  string  had  been
          typed as a command at a terminal. Current process waits
          until  the  shell  has  completed then returns the exit
          status of the shell.


     EERRRROORRSS
          An exit status of 127 means  the  shell  could  not  be
          executed.
