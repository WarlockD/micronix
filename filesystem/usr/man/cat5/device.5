          The  line  printer  spooler  program  searches  for and
          follows the directives found in this file. The file  is
          entered  free-form,  that  is,  order  and  spacing  of
          specifiers given within this file are unimportant.
          
          The following is a list of specifiers that may appear:


             A baud rate given as a decimal number. Example  baud
             rates:  9600,  1200, 300, 110, etc. All the standard
             baud rates are supported. The default baud  rate  is
             9600.

             An  indication to use hardware handshaking, i.e., to
             transmit  only  when  the   clear-to-send   pin   is
             asserted.  The indicator is simply the word "shake".
             By default, clear-to-send is ignored.

             The name of the device to which to send the  spooled
             files  for printing. This must be the full path name
             of a character special  file.  Examples:  /dev/ttyA,
             /dev/ttyB,  /dev/ttyC,  /dev/pprA,  /dev/ttyD,  etc.
             Default is /dev/lp.
