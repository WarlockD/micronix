          ttttyyss - typewriter (terminal) initialization data


     FFUUNNCCTTIIOONN
          The ttttyyss file is read by the iinniitt program and specifies
          which  typewriter  special  files are to have a process
          created for them which will  allow  users  to  log  in.
          There  is  one line in the file for each typewriter. It
          is  good  practice  to   maintain   entries   for   all
          typewriters  in  the  system,  including those that are
          turned off.
          
          The format of each line of the ttttyyss file may be entered
          free-form, i.e., in  any  order,  with  any  amount  of
          spaces between the specifiers.
          
          Four  specifiers  may  be  entered;  only one is really
          required, though. Let's take a sample line from a  ttttyyss
          file.

               ttttyyAA     99660000    oonn      sshhaakkee

          The  device  name (ttyA in this example) _m_u_s_t appear on
          the line.
          
          If no baud rate is given, the default baud rate of 9600
          is used.
          
          If no "on" or "off" specifier is given, by default  the
          port will be on.
          
          If  no "shake" specifier is given, hardware handshaking
          will not be used. (In most cases, the "shake" option is
          not used and should not be specified.  It  is  required
          only for some slow printers and terminals.)
          
          In  the  above  example, ttyA is active (on) and set at
          9600 baud with hardware handshaking.  It  is  possible,
          however to set up three terminals that run at 9600 baud
          and   that  do  not  require  hardware  handshaking  as
          follows:

                ttyA
                ttyB
                ttyC
