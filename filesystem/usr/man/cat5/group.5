          Each  user  name  is  associated  with  a group number.
          Associated with each file is  a  user  ID  number  (the
          owner  of the file) and a group ID number (the group of
          the  file).  These  numbers  are  used  in   permission
          determinations.
          
          The  relationship  between  group  numbers and names is
          established by the group file. The format of the  group
          file is as follows:

             Each line of the file defines one group name.
             
             The group name is followed by a colon, then followed
             by the encrypted group password, if one exists. This
             is  followed  by  a  colon, which is followed by the
             group number (in  decimal),  followed  by  a  colon,
             followed  by  the  group  comment  field  which  may
             contain anything you desire, or nothing at all.


          Here is a sample group file:

                 ssaalleess::::44::
                 ssttoocckk::::55::


          Normally group 0 is reserved for the  super-user  only.
          The nneewwuusseerr program makes additions to this file.
