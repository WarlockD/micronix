          ddttaabb - the dump table


     FFUUNNCCTTIIOONN
          Information on the times of a dump are kept in the file
          "/etc/dtab."  This  is  a non-ASCII file presently used
          only by ttdd (1). Each entry in ddttaabb is eight bytes  long
          and takes the form:
          
          
               ssttrruucctt ddttaabb
                {{
                iinntt     ddeevviiccee,,
                        iinnooddee;;
               
                lloonngg    ddaattee;;
                }};;


          There  is  an entry in ddttaabb for each directory that has
          been dumped by ttdd.. Device  is  the  major/minor  device
          number  of  the  directory  in  question  (major device
          number in the high byte, minor in the low byte).  Inode
          is  the inode number of the directory. Date is the time
          of the last recorded dump of the directory in  question
          expressed  as a 4-byte quantity representing the number
          of seconds elapsed since Jan. 1, 1970 at midnight.
