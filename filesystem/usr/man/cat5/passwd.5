          The  name passwd has become a misnomer, but is commonly
          found in UNIX documentation and we hesitate  to  change
          it here.

          PPaasssswwdd contains the following information:

             name (login name, no upper case letters)
             encrypted password
             numerical user ID
             numerical group ID
             comment
             home directory
             command   interpreter  program  name  with  optional
             arguments

          This is an ASCII file. Each field  within  each  user's
          entry  is separated from the next by a colon. Each user
          is separated from the next  by  a  newline.  This  file
          resides in the "/etc" directory.
          
          The  first entry of the password file contains an entry
          for the super-user account. The name of this account is
          traditionally "root," but may be  renamed  to  anything
          the user wishes.
