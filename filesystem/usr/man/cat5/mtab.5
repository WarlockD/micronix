          mmttaabb - mounted file system table


     FFUUNNCCTTIIOONN
          MMttaabb resides in the /etc directory and contains a table
          of  devices  "mounted" by the mmoouunntt command. The uummoouunntt
          command removes entries.
          
          Each entry is 64 bytes long. The first 32 bytes are the
          null padded name of the place where the special file is
          mounted; the second 32 are the null padded name of  the
          special  file. The special file has all its directories
          stripped away, that is, everything through the last '/'
          is thrown away.
          
          This table is present only so people can look at it. It
          does  not  matter  to  mmoouunntt  if  there  are  duplicate
          entries, nor to uummoouunntt if a name cannot be found.
