          Micronix  uses  the  standard  UNIX version 6 directory
          format. A  directory  behaves  like  an  ordinary  file
          except  that  a  user may write into a file, but cannot
          write into a directory.
          
          A directory is distinguished from a file by  a  bit  in
          the  flag  word  of its i-node entry. Directory entries
          are 16 bytes long. The first word is  the  i-number  of
          the file, represented by the entry if non-zero.
          
          If the first word is zero, the entry is empty.
          
          Bytes   2   through  15  of  the  entry  represent  the
          14-character file name, null padded on the right. These
          bytes are not cleared for empty slots.
          
          By convention, the first two entries in each  directory
          are  for  "."  and  "..". The first is an entry for the
          directory  itself.  The  second  is  for   the   parent
          directory.
          
          The  meaning of ".." is modified for the root directory
          of the master file system and for the root  directories
          of  removable file systems. In the first case, there is
          no parent, and in  the  second,  the  system  does  not
          permit  off-device  references.  In both cases ".." has
          the same meaning as ".".
