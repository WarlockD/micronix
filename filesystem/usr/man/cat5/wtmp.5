          wwttmmpp - user login history


     FFUUNNCCTTIIOONN
          This file records all logins and logouts. Its format is
          like  uuttmmpp  (5) with these exceptions: A null user name
          indicates  a  logout  on  the  associated   typewriter.
          Furthermore, the typewriter name ~~ indicates the system
          was  rebooted  at the indicated time; the adjacent pair
          of entries with typewriter names || and }}  indicate  the
          system-maintained  time  just  before  and just after a
          ddaattee command changed the systems'  idea  of  the  time.
          WWttmmpp  is  maintained by llooggiinn (1) and iinniitt (1). Neither
          of these  programs  creates  the  file,  so  if  is  is
          removed, record-keeping is turned off.
