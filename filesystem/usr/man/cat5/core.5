          A  core  file  is produced by the system as a result of
          certain fatal signals; the offending  program  is  then
          terminated.  The  file  produced is named "core" in the
          current directory of the dumped program at the time  of
          the  fatal  signal. The format of the core dump file is
          as follows:
          
          The first 65,536 bytes are simply a "snapshot"  of  the
          program  as  it  appeared  in  memory  at  the critical
          instant. Following this "memory image" is certain other
          pertinent information, mostly the contents of the Z80's
          registers:

              Task: Micronix task number
              Mask: The MPZ80 permission mode
              PC:   Program counter
              SP:   Stack pointer
    Registers:
              af    
              bc    
              de
