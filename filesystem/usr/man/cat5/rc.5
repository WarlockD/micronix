          The   iinniitt   (initialization)  program  looks  for  the
          "/etc/rc" file  just  before  entering  the  multi-user
          mode.  If  such a file is found, and is readable, it is
          run as a shell script. That is, each of the commands in
          the file is executed as if from the keyboard.
          
          Typically, it  is  used  to  clean  out  the  temporary
          directory,  remove locked files, start up daemons, etc.
          The user may place whatever he desires in the file.
