          The  contents  of  the  source  directory  and  all its
          descendants are copied into the destination directory.
          
          The destination directory must exist, but  ccppttrreeee  will
          create any needed sub-directories.
          
          If  either  the  source  or  destination  names are not
          given, ccppttrreeee will ask for them.
          
          If --vv is in the command line, ccppttrreeee  will  print  each
          operation in the tree copy as it is performed.
          
          It  is  permissible  to  copy a tree into a sub-tree of
          itself. CCppttrreeee will avoid getting into a wormhole.
