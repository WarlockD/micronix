     USAGE
          llss [[--aaddffggiillrrssttuu]] nnaammee ......

          LLss  lists all the named non-directories first, then the
          contents of each  named  directory.  If  no  names  are
          specified, the current directory is listed.
          
          There   are   three   basic   printing  formats:  line,
          multi-column, and long.
          
          Line format is one file to a line.
          
          In multi-column format, llss produces a rectangular array
          of file names sorted down the  page  and  compacted  as
          much as possible within an 80 column width.
          
          In  long  format, files are listed one to a line with a
          lot of information about each file packed into the line
          (see -l below).
          
          Long format is explicitly forced by the -l or -g option
          (see below). Otherwise, llss chooses line or multi-cloumn
          format automatically, depending on whether its standard
          output is a file or a terminal.
          
          Options:
          
          --aa   AAllll.. NNoorrmmaallllyy,, ffiilleess nnaammeess bbeeggiinnnniinngg wwiitthh ''..''  aarree
               nnoott lliisstteedd.. If -a is specified, they are listed.
               
          --dd   DDiirreeccttoorryy.. Normally, if a directory name is given,
               its  contents  is listed. If -d is specified, then
               only the name is printed  (along  with  any  other
               attributes called for by other options).
               
          --ff   FFiillee  oorrddeerr..  Disable  all  sorting  and print the
               files in the order they  actually  appear  in  the
               directory.
               
          --gg   GGrroouupp..  For  each  file,  print  the  name  of the
               owner's group, instead of the owner's login  name.
               The latter is the default for long listings. (This
               option  forces  a  long listing, whether or not -l
               has been specified.)
               
          -i   Print the inode number of each file.

               Long printing format is laid out as follows:
               
               Each line refers to one file. The  fields  printed
               are:

                     mmooddee  lliinnkkss  oowwnneerr  ssiizzee  ttiimmee   nnaammee

               Mode   is  the  access  permissions  of  the  file
               symbolically displayed.
               
               Links is the number of links to the file.
               
               Owner is the login name of the user who  owns  the
               file.
               
               Size  is  the size of the file in bytes (or blocks
               with the -s option)
               
               Time is the last modification time (or last access
               time) of the file.
               
               
               The mode takes the form:

                                --[[bbccdd]]rrwwxxrrwwxxrrwwxx

               The -- stands for  plain  file  or  permission  not
               granted; the

                    b stands for block special file
                    c stands for character special file
                    d stands for directory

               Files  may  also  have  the  following  characters
               interspersed within these descriptions:

                    l stands for write locked file
                    s stands for set user or group ID on execution

ls (1)                        6/25/82                       ls (1)


                    r stands for read permission
                    w stands for write permission
                    x stands for execute permission

               If   a   letter   is   missing   in   the    above
               representation,  it  indicates that permission for
               that mode of access is not permitted.

                       ddrrwwxxrr--xxrr--xx
               
               The dd means this is a directory.
               
               The rrwwxx means the owner of the directory  has  all
               permissions.
               
               The  rr--xx  means  those  user's  in the directory's
               group have only read and search permission on  the
               directory.  Likewise  for  others (those users who
               are neither the owner of the directory nor in  the
               same group).


                       --rrll--rr----rr----

               -- means this is a plain file.

               rrll--  means  the  file is readable by the owner and
               write locked.

               rr---- means the file is readable  by  those  in  the
               group.
               
               the  second  rr----  means  the  file  is readable by
               anyone else on the system also.
