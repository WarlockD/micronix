          TTaaiill  prints  the  last  n  lines (default = 10) of the
          named file. If no file  is  given,  the  last  n  lines
          before   the   first  end-of-file  encountered  on  the
          standard input are printed.

          TTaaiill reads the entire file in order to obtain the  last
          few  lines.  If n is too large, ttaaiill will fail since it
          stores the text of lines in memory.
