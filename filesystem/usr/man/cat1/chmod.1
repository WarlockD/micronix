          The mode of each named file is changed according to the
          mode  argument,  which  may be an octal number (such as
          766) or a symbolic expression (such as u=rw).
          
          Brief summary
          
          The symbolic mode may be  a  comma-seperated  list  (no
          spaces) of commands, each of which has the form
                [augo] [+-=] [rwxslugo]
          with one or more letters chosen from each set. a = all,
          u  = user, g = group, o = other, r = read, w = write, x
          = execute (or search when applied to a directory), s  =
          set  id  on  execution, l = write lock. + means add the
          bits (logical OR), - means delete the bits (logical AND
          with the compliment), and = means  assignment  (logical
          set and clear).
          
          Explanation
          We  will  first give a brief discussion of the Micronix
          file protection system:
          
          The file  protection  system  allows  one  to  restrict
          access  to  files  based  upon two different criteria -
          namely, _w_h_o is trying to access the file and  _h_o_w  they
          are trying to access it.
          
          For  the  purposes  of  file  protection, all users are
          divided into three categories:
          
          1)   The owner of the file.
               
          2)   Those in the same group as the file's owner.
               
          3)   Others.  (Those  not  meeting  one  of  the  above
               criteria.)
               
          How  a  file  is accessed is composed of one or more of
          the following:
          
          1)   Access for reading.
               
          2)   Access for writing.
               
          3)   Access  for   program   execution   or   directory
               searching.

          There are nine file permission mode bits: three for the
          owner, three for the group and three for others.
          
          The meanings of the nine bits are as follows:
          
               Allow:
          
                    Reading by the owner
                    Writing by the owner
                    Execution by the owner
          
                    Reading by the group
                    Writing by the group
                    Execution by the group
          
                    Reading by others
                    Writing by others
                    Execution by others
          
          There  are  also  3  other mode bits that can be set or
          cleared by chmod.
          
                    Set user id on execution
                    Set group id on execution
                    Lock the file when it is opened for writing
          
          The first two apply only to programs. Ordinarily,  when
          a  program  is  executed, it is tagged with the name of
          the user who executes it, and  thereafter  it  has  the
          same  access  permissions.  But  consider the following
          situation. Suppose that you  have  written  a  spelling
          checking  program  that  uses a copyrighted dictionary.
          You must prevent others from copying the dictionary, so
          you must prevent "read" access by "others". But when an
          "other" executes  the  spelling  program,  how  is  the
          program  going  to read the dictionary? The solution is
          provided by turning on  the  speller's  "set  user  id"
          flag.  This  causes  the  program to be tagged with its
          creator's name, not with its executor's. Then  as  long
          as you set the dictionary's "owner" permission to allow
          reading,  the  speller  can  read  the dictionary, even
          though the person who invokes the speller cannot.
          
          The "set group id" flag behaves similarly, except  that
          it  only  gives  the  program  the  permissions  of its
          creator's group.
          
          The write lock flag prevents more than one program at a
          time from holding a file  open  for  writing.  This  is
          especially  useful  for  protecting  the  database of a
          single-user program that is run  multi-user  under  the
          Micronix CP/M emulator.

chmod (1)                    6/25/82                    chmod (1)


          The format of the mode argument to cchhmmoodd is as follows:
          
               WWHHOO ooppeerraanndd HHOOWW
          
          where  WHO is a combination of the letters a, u, g, and
          o (for all, user, group, and other); the operand is  +,
          -,  or  =  (for  add,  delete,  and  set); and HOW is a
          combination of the letters r, w, x, s, and l (for read,
          write, execute, set-id, and lock). HOW may also contain
          the letters u, g, and o (see below).


     EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS
          To set a file "wide open" so that anyone may access it:
          
               cchhmmoodd aa==rrwwxx ffiillee
          
          This sets all  permissions  set  to  read,  write,  and
          execute.


               cchhmmoodd uu==rrww ffiillee
          
          This  sets  the user permissions to read and write (but
          not  execute),  and  leaves   the   group   and   other
          permissions unchanged.


               cchhmmoodd ggoo--wwxx **..cc
          
          Group  and others have the write and execute permission
          taken away on all files ending with ".c".


               cchhmmoodd uu++ss ssppeellll
          
          This sets the "set user id" flag on the spell program.


               cchhmmoodd ++ll ddaattaabbaassee
          
          This sets the lock flag on the database. (Since the lock
          flag applies equally to user, group, and others, the
          WHO part of the operand may be left out here.)


               cchhmmoodd oo--xx,,gg==oo **
          
          This takes all files, removes execute permission from others,
          and then sets the group equal to the others.
