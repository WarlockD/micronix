          CCuu  may  be  used  to connect to other machines through
          your Micronix machine.
          
          When the ccuu command is given, one process is set up  to
          handle  sending characters to the remote system, one is
          set up to receive them. Much of this is not obvious  to
          the user.
          
          When  ccuu is ready it prints a "~". Thereafter, whatever
          you type will be immediately sent to the  remote  port,
          and  whatever  is  received  from  it  is  sent to your
          terminal. So, typically, you press a single key on your
          terminal, Micronix takes it and re-transmits it to  the
          remote  machine,  which  will  usually send it back, at
          which point Micronix receives it and sends it  to  your
          terminal and you see the character on your screen!
          
          There is definitely an upper limit to the baud rate you
          can  use for the remote port - 1200 baud is the highest
          recommended. If the remote machine is another  Micronix
          machine,  additional  commands  apply.  You many copy a
          file from local to remote machine via:

                ~~%%ppuutt ffiillee

          Or from remote to local via:

                ~~%%ttaakkee ffiillee

          Note only text files may be copied reliably. This  need
          not  be  a  drawback,  however, because any file can be
          converted into  a  text  file,  transferred,  and  then
          converted back again.
          
          Both the sending and receiving processes recognize

                ~~>>ffiillee
          
                ~>

          as  starting  and ending delimiters for file diversion,
          so that in order to copy a file from a  foreign  system
          to the local one, all you have to do is get the foreign
          system to generate:

                ~~>>ffiilleennaammee
                Text of file ...
                more file ...
                ~>

          That  is, a beginning marker, the text of the file, and
          then an ending marker.
          
          To get out of ccuu type:

                ~~..

          To set up communication over a modem, get your hardware
          set up and then type:

                  ccuu //ddeevv//ttttyyCC --ss 330000
          
          In  this  example  the  modem  would  be  plugged  into
          Micronix port C (the third one).
          
          Typically,  one  must  reverse the transmit and receive
          lines in the cable running from  the  computer  to  the
          modem.  One  reverses the wires running to pins 2 and 3
          of the connector at one end or the other.
