          FFoorrmm  is  a  general  purpose  text formatter with text
          filling, underline,  indenting,  centering,  and  other
          useful  capabilities.  This document was prepared using
          ffoorrmm..

          The standard input is read and formatted  according  to
          instructions  embedded in the input file; the result is
          written to the standard output.
          
          If a list of files names is given, they are used as the
          input. If "-o" followed by a file name appears  on  the
          command line, then the output is written into the named
          file.
          
          If "-t" appears on the command line, then the output is
          made more suitable for a glass tty, i.e. long sequences
          of blank lines are avoided.

          Input  consists of text lines interspersed with command
          lines destined to be printed
          
          If the first character of a line is a period (.),  ffoorrmm
          attempts  to  interpret  the  line as a command; in any
          case, the text of such lines will not  appear  verbatim
          in the output.

          The following commands are implemented:


           ..bbdd nn
          
          Cause  the next (or number of given) line(s) of text to
          be double-striked for bold face appearance. (Default is
          1.) Printer must have double-strike ability,  otherwise
          oovveerrssttrriikkee (Section 1) must be implemented.
          
          
           ..bbpp nn
          
          Begin  page number n. Jump to the top of the next page.
          Set the page number to n (default is  sequential  order
          beginning with 1).

          Cause break. The next input line will begin at the left
          margin.

           ..ccee nn
          
          Center  the  next  (or  number of given) input line(s).
          Default is next line only.


           ..ffii
          
          Set filled text mode. All text lines will be filled out
          with blanks if necessary so that the  right  margin  is
          justified. Fill mode is the initial default condition.


           ..ffoo TTEEXXTT
          
          Set  the  footer. The specified text will be printed at
          the bottom of each page.


           ..hhee TTEEXXTT
          
          Set the header. The specified text will be  printed  at
          the top of each following page.


           ..iinn nn
          
          Set  the  indent.  The indent is set to the nth column.
          The command ".in 0" is interpreted to mean  no  indent.
          Default is 0.


           ..llss nn
          
          Set the line spacing to n lines. The command ".ls 2" is
          interpreted  to  mean double space. The line spacing is
          set to 1 (default) initially.


           ..nnff
          
          No fill. Turns off  fill  mode;  lines  are  no  longer
          justified.


           ..ppll nn
          
          Page length. The page length is set to n lines long. If
          no  number  (n) is specified, the page length is set to
          66 lines (default).

           ..rrmm nn
          
          Right margin. The right margin is set at column  n.  If
          no  number  (n)  is  specified,  it is set at column 60
          (default).


           ..sspp nn
          
          Space down n lines. If no number (n) is given, spaces 1
          line (default).


           ..ttaa nn
          
          Set the tab. Value  (n)  determines  amount  of  tabbed
          spaces.  Entered with ^I sequence or TAB key. When used
          with next (.ti) command, produces "hanging" paragraphs.
          
          
           ..ttii nn
          
          Temporary indent. The indent is set to a value (n)  for
          the  next line only. This is quite useful for numbering
          paragraphs - a  negative  value  produces  a  "hanging"
          paragraph.


           ..uull nn
          
          Cause the next (or number of given) input line(s) to be
          underlined.   The  default  is  1.  Printer  must  have
          double-strike capability. If not,  see  the  oovveerrssttrriikkee
          program  (Section  1)  for instructions on implementing
          this program.
