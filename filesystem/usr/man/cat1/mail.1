          Micronix  has  an  inter-user  mail  system.  The  mmaaiill
          program sends letters to the appropriate  system  user.
          Letters are sent to another user by entering:

               % mail user name
               
               To  enter  the letter, just begin typing. Enter as
               many lines as necessary. Letters are terminated by
               entering a single period, or a ^D at the beginning
               of the last line.

          The next time the user logs in, he will be greeted with
          the message "You have mail".
          
          To read his mail, he simply enters

               %% mmaaiill

          The letter is printed on-screen. The user is then asked
          if he wants to keep his mail.
          
          The appropriate reply is "yes" to keep it, or  "no"  to
          delete  it.  Kept  mail is stored in the "mbox" file in
          the user's directory.
