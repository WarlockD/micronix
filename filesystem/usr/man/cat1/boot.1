        The  CP/M  diskette that comes with Micronix includes the
        following bootstrap programs:
        
        djboot  Boot from the DJDMA controller with a 5  inch  or
                an 8 inch drive.
                
        hdboot  Boot  from  the HDCA controller the 10, 20, or 26
                megabyte drive
                
        m5boot  Boot  from  the  HDDMA  controller  with  the   5
                megabyte drive
                
        m10boot Boot  from  the  HDDMA  controller  with  the  10
                megabyte drive
                
        m16boot Boot  from  the  HDDMA  controller  with  the  16
                megabyte drive
        
        These  are CP/M programs, ie, they are stored on the CP/M
        diskette as djboot.com, hdboot.com, etc, and are  invoked
        from CP/M by typing the name without the .com extension.
        
        In each case, they assume that the target disk contains a
        Micronix  file system, and they search its root directory
        for files that could be Micronix kernels. If exactly  one
        such  file  is  found, it is loaded and executed. If more
        than one kernel is found, the names are  listed  and  the
        operator  is  asked choose one. This allows backup copies
        or alternate versions to be kept.
        
        CP/M's only role in this process is the invocation of the
        bootstrap program. Once the bootstrap  begins  executing,
        it is independent of CP/M, and CP/M itself is overwritten
        as Micronix is loaded.
        
        CP/M  can  be  eliminated entirely by placing the desired
        bootstrap program on the  "system  tracks"  of  a  floppy
        disk.  Then  as  long  as  that  diskette  is in drive A,
        Micronix will boot  automatically  from  the  appropriate
        hard  disk every time the Decision's RESET button is hit.
        This should save the operator about 5  seconds  per  day.
        (CAUTION:  if  Micronix is already running, make sure you
        type sync before hitting RESET.)

        tracks are stored as files on the Micronix CP/M diskette,
        and  are  called  hdload,  m5load,  m10load, and m16load,
        corresponding to the similarly-named bootstrap  programs.
        See below for an installation example. The djboot program
        has  already  been  placed  on  the  system tracks of the
        Micronix stand-alone floppy, so if you put this in  drive
        A and hit RESET, it will boot automatically.

        The bootstrap programs only search the first block of the
        root  directory,  so you should limit your root directory
        to 32 entries (which is a good idea anyway, to  speed  up
        rooted  file-name searches), or else you should make sure
        that the Micronix kernel occurs as one of  the  first  32
        entries.
