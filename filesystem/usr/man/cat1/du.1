          DDuu  find  the amount of storage space used by the files
          whose names are given. If a directory  name  is  given,
          then  the  disk  usage is reported for all the files in
          the directory and the same is done for  each  directory
          on down the tree.
          
          If  and  when disk space becomes an issue, this program
          can be very useful at showing you where all  your  disk
          space is going.
          
          If there are several links to a file, the space used by
          the file is counted only once.
          
          Space  used  by  directories themselves is not counted,
          nor are indirect blocks, as these are considered system
          overhead and in any event do not amount to more than  a
          few percent.
          
          The  program  doesn't  know  about  files with holes in
          them: they are counted as if all the holes were filled.

          Options:
          
          -a   All. Normally a total block count is produced only
               for each directory. With the -a option in  effect,
               a   block   count   is  produced  for  each  file,
               regardless.
               
          -s   Summary. Only a grand total is printed.

          To find out just how much space you are  using,  simply
          enter:

               dduu --ss
          
          To  find  out which directory has that enormous file in
          it:

               dduu
          
          To get the name of the offending file itself:

               dduu --aa
