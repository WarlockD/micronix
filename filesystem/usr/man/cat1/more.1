          MMoorree  allows you to scroll through the named files on a
          video terminal, one screen  full  at  a  time.  At  the
          bottom  of  the screen, it prints "--More--" and waits.
          Press carriage return to continue, delete to  quit.  If
          no file names are given, the standard input is used.
