          OObbjj  permits  inspection of relocatable object files in
          standard form for any target machine.  Such  files  may
          have  been output by an assembler, combined by link, or
          archived by lliibb.. OObbjj can be used either to check  their
          size  and  configuration, or to output information from
          their symbol tables.
          
          The flags are:

          -d   Output all defined symbols in each file,  one  per
               line.  Each line contains the value of the symbol,
               a code indicating to what the value  is  relative,
               and  the  symbol  name.  values  are output as the
               number of digits needed to represent an integer on
               the target machine. Relocation codes are: "T"  for
               test  relative, "D" for data relative, "B: for bss
               relative, "A" for absolute, or  "?"  for  anything
               oobbjj does not recognize. Lowercase letters are used
               for local symbols, uppercase for globals.
               
          -g   Print global symbols only.
               
          -i   Print  all  global  symbols  with  the interval in
               bytes between successive  symbols  shown  in  each
               value field. Implies the flags -[d u v].
               
          -o   Output   symbol   values   in  octal.  Default  is
               hexadecimal.
               
          -s   Display  the  sizes,  in  decimal,  of  the   text
               segment,  the  data  segment, the bss segment, and
               the space reserved  for  the  runtime  stack  plus
               heap, followed by the sum of all the sizes.
               
          -t   List  type  information  for  this  file. For each
               object file the data  file  is:  the  size  of  an
               integer  on  the target machine, the byte order it
               observes, the most restrictive  storage  bound  it
               enforces,  and the maximum number of characters it
               permits in  an  external  name.  If  the  file  is
               library,  the  type  of  library is output and the
               information above is output for each module in the
               library.

          -u   List all undefined symbols in each file. If -d  is
               also  specified,  each  undefined symbol is listed
               with the code "U". The value of  each  symbol,  if
               non-zero,  is  the  space to be reserved for it at
               load time if it is not explicitly defined.
               
          -v   Sort by value; implies the -d flag above.  Symbols
               of equal value are sorted alphabetically.
               
          If  no flags are given, the default is -[d u]; that is,
          all symbols are listed, sorted in alphabetical order on
          symbol name. If more than one of the flags -[d s  t  y]
          is  selected,  then  type  information is output first,
          followed by segment sizes, followed by the symbol  list
          specified with -d or -u.
          
          <files>  specifies zero or more files, which must be in
          relocatable format, or standard library format,  or  in
          UNIX/V6  library  format, or UNIX/V7 library format. If
          more than one file, or a  library,  is  specified,  the
          name  of  ech  separate  file  or  module  precedes any
          information output for it,  each  name  followed  by  a
          colon  and  a newline; if -s is given, a line of totals
          is also output. If no <files> are specified, or if  "-"
          is encountered on the command line, xeq is used.

          OObbjj  returns  success  if  no diagnostics are produced,
          that is, if all  reads  are  successful  and  all  file
          formats are valid.
