          CCcc  is  the  Whitesmiths'  C  compiler  supervisor;  it
          accepts several types of arguments:
          
          Those ending with ".p" are assumed to be Pascal  source
          files and are converted to ".c" files. Arguments ending
          with  ".c"  are  taken  to  be  C  source files and are
          compiled with each relocatable object  module  left  in
          the file named for the source with ".o" substituted for
          ".c".
          
          In  the  same  way, arguments whose names end with ".s"
          are taken to be A-natural source files and are compiled
          to produce an ".o" file.
          
          The following options are meaningful to cccc::
          
          -c        Suppress   the   loading   phase    of    the
                    compilation,  and  force object file(s) to be
                    produced for each source file.
                    
          -i name   Passed   on   to   ccpppp,,   the   C    compiler
                    preprocessor.  Name is a prefix to be used on
                    "# include <files>".
                    
          -o file   The result of the compilation will be written
                    on the named  file.  If  no  "-o"  option  is
                    given, the output is written to "a.out"
                    
          -lX       Library  inclusion.  The  file  "/lib/libX.a"
                    will be included in the linking phase of  the
                    compilation. An example is included below.
                    
          -lS       Use  the standard I/O library. Note that this
                    only  affects  the  loading  phase   of   the
                    compilation.  If  you  use  the library, your
                    programs should include the line:

                                 ## iinncclluuddee <<ssttddiioo..hh>>


          -cpm      Compile to run under CP/M.
                    
          -ws       Use the Whitesmiths' C library.

          -xN       where N is a number. Arguments of  this  type
                    are  passed on to pass 2 of the compiler; see
