          The  standard  input  is  copied to the standard output
          with the exception of each line beginning with:

                  iinncclluuddee ffiilleennaammee

          which is replaced by the contents of  the  named  file.
          Includes  may  be nested; that is, an included file may
          invoke another file for inclusion. If a named  file  is
          not  openable,  an  error  message  is  printed and the
          program terminates abruptly.
