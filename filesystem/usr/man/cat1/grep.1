          Lines  in  each of the named files matching the regular
          expression  "pattern"  are  written  on  the   standard
          output.  The  rules  for  regular expressions are as in
          eeddiitt..

          The following flags are meaningful in the command line:
          
          
          -c        Only a count of matching lines is printed for
                    each file.

          -i        The   case   of   letters   is   ignored   in
                    comparisons.

          -l        The  names of files containing matching lines
                    are listed once, one on a line.

          -n        Each matching line is preceded  by  its  line
                    number in its respective file.

          -v        All   lines  _n_o_t  matching  the  pattern  are
                    printed.
