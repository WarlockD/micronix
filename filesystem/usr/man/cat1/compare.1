          CCoommppaarree  reads  the  two named files, line by line, and
          announces  any  differing  lines,  including  the  line
          number.

          To  find  the  differing  line  in two nearly identical
          files:

                         ccoommppaarree vveerrssiioonn11 vveerrssiioonn22

          The algorithm is very poor if lines have been added  or
          deleted  to  one of the files. Compare will then report
          that all of the following lines  differ  when  in  fact
          only  a small change may have been made between the two
          files.
