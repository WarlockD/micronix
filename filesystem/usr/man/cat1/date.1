          Only the super-user may set the time. If no argument is
          given,   the   current   date  and  time  are  printed.
          Otherwise, all of the arguments are taken together with
          the present date and time to produce  a  new  date  and
          time. The systems' idea of the time is set.

          given as decimal numbers.
          
          [[mmoonntthh]]  is  the  name  of a month, in English; case is
          ignored. The first three letters of  the  name  of  the
          month must be given.
          
          If  any  specification is omitted, the current value of
          that specification is used in its stead. A common error
          is to attempt to set the day of the week. This  is  not
          permissable in the command line.

          The  clock is subject to hardware-induced problems that
          may cause the time to be off occasionally.
