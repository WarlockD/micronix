          All of the named input files are sorted together.
          
          If  no  input  file  names are given, then the standard
          input is used instead.
          
          The result is written to the standard output unless  an
          output file name is given (with the -o option).
          
          The default sorting key is the entire line.
          
          Ordering   is   lexicographic,  by  bytes,  in  machine
          collating sequence.
          
          The following optional flags may be used  to  influence
          the sorting.
          
          
                +N      Sort  by  the  Nth  column  over from the
                        left. Default is column 0.
                        
                -b      Ignore leading blanks (spaces  and  tabs)
                        in comparisons.
                        
                -d      Dictionary  order,  only  letters, digits
                        and    blanks    are    significant    in
                        comparisons.
                        
                -f      Ignore case in comparisons.
                        
                -i      Ignore non-ascii characters.
                        
                -n      Sort   by  integral  number.  Fields  are
                        ordered by numerical value.
                        
                -o file Send the output to the named  file  "sort
                        file -o file" will work.
                        
                -r      Reverse. Sort backwards.
                        
                -tx     Tab character is set to the character x.
                        
                        
              '-' options listed above may be combined.
              
              That is

                sort -b -d -f -i
              
              is the same as

              SSoorrtt  can be used on arbitrarily large files. It is
              limited only by the amount of temporary file  space
              it can consume.
              
              
         EXAMPLES
              
              
              A  simple  example,  to  see what a file looks like
              once sorted:
              
                sort file
              
              
              To sort by the second column:
              
                sort +1 file
              
              To sort a list of numbers:
              
                sort -n file
              
              To sort a file in place:
              
                sort file -o file
              
              To sort the password file by numerical user id
              
                sort +2 -t: -n /etc/passwd
