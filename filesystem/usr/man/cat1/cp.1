     FUNCTION
          The first named file is copied to the second.
          
          If  the  last  named  file  is a directory, each of the
          preceding named files are copied "into the directory".
          
          CCpp refuses to  copy  a  file  to  itself  or  with  the
          directory  as  source.  That  is,  "file"  is copied to
          "dir/file".
          
          CCpp,, as a command under Micronix, is analogous (but  not
          identical) to PIP under CP/M. It is the most common and
          efficient way to copy files.
          
          
     SSEEEE AALLSSOO
          mv  (1), common (1) and cptree (1) to copy large groups
          of files
