          Translit  can  be  used  to perform a variety of useful
          character  mapping  functions.  TTrraannsslliitt  modifies  its
          input   on  a  character-by-character  basis.  TTrraannsslliitt
          changes  each  character  in  its  ffrroomm  set   to   the
          corresponding one in its ttoo set. If there is no ttoo set,
          the  effect  is  to  remove each character found in the
          ffrroomm set. If the ttoo set has fewer characters  than  the
          ffrroomm  set, the last character in the ttoo set is repeated
          as many times as needed to fill out the ttoo set.

          Notation of the form x-y may be used as  shorthand  set
          notation to mean all the characters lexically between x
          and  y,  where  x and y are letters of the same case or
          both digits.

          If ^^ is the first character of the ffrroomm  specification,
          it  is  understood  to  mean  all characters _n_o_t in the
          following specification.

          Notation of the form @@337777 (an "at" sign followed by  up
          to  three  digits  of  octal)  may  be  used to specify
          characters by ASCII value.

          If the ffrroomm set contains fewer characters than  the  ttoo
          set,  or  if the ^^ is used as above, the last character
          of the ttoo set is sufficiently replicated  to  fill  the
          ffrroomm  set  to  the  size  of  the  ttoo set. Furthermore,
          contiguous characters which are elements of the ttoo  set
          for  which there is no explicit corresponding character
          in the ttoo set are collapsed to a single  occurrence  of
          the last character in the specification for the ttoo set.

          To replace all occurrences of x by y:

          To change x to y and y to x:

                  ttrraannsslliitt xxyy yyxx <<iinnppuutt >>oouuttppuutt
