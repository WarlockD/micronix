          The named special file is dismounted.
          
          The special file must have been previously mounted with
          the mmoouunntt command.
          
          It  is  not  permitted  to  dismount a file system with
          files still open. Diagnostic: "Device busy".
          
          Sometimes it is necessary to use the "change directory"
          command before dismounting a device. As an example:

               ccdd //;; uummoouunntt //ddeevv//ddjjaa

          to dismount a floppy.
