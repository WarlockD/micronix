          IIcchheecckk  assumes  "filesystem"  is the name of a special
          file containing a Micronix file system.
          
          IIcchheecckk checks the inodes (block pointers) and the  free
          list to see that no block is referenced more than once.
          
          It also prints statistics about the file system.
          
          -s        causes the free list to be reconstructed from
                    scratch.
                    
          -b        followed  by  a  list  of  block numbers will
                    cause  the  requested  block  numbers  to  be
                    called out when they are encountered.
                    
          IIcchheecckk can take several minutes on a large file system.

          To check the root file system:

                             iicchheecckk //ddeevv//rroooott
          
          
     NNOOTTEESS
          Be sure that the file system in question is not active.
