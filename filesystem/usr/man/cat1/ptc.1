     FFUUNNCCTTIIOONN
          PPttcc  is a program that accepts as input lines of Pascal
          text and produces as output a corresponding  C  program
          which   is   acceptable  to  the  Whitesmiths,  Ltd.  C
          compiler. If <file> is present,  it  is  taken  as  the
          Pascal  program  to translate; otherwise input is taken
          from STDIN.
          
          The flags are:

          -c   Pass comments through to the C program.
               
          -f   Set the precision for reals  to  single  precision
               (float). Default is double.
               
          -k   Permit  pointer  types  to  be  defined using type
               identifiers from  outer  blocks.  Default  is  ISO
               standard,  i.e.,  the  type  pointed  to  must  be
               defined  in  the  same  type  declaration  as  the
               pointer type definition.
               
          -m#  Make  # the number of bits in MAXINT excluding the
               sign bit, e.g., MAXINT becomes 32767 for  -m15,  1
               for  -m,  etc.  Default for MAXINT is 32766 [sic].
               Acceptable values for # are in the range [0, 32).
               
          -o*  Write the C program to the file * and  diagnostics
               to STDOUT. Default is STDOUT for the C program and
               STDERR for diagnostics.
               
          -r   Turn off runtime array bounds checks.
               
          -s#  Make # the number of bits in the maximum allowable
               set  size,  i.e.,  the size of all sets whose base
               type is integer becomes  the  specified  power  of
               two.  Acceptable  values are in the range [0, 32).
               Default is 8 (256 elements).
               
          The CP/M operating system implementation on  the  Intel
          8080 and Zilog Z80 restricts the acceptable value for #
          to  the  range  [0,  16]; for maximum portability, this
          restriction should be honored.
          
          Identifiers  are  mapped  to  uppercase  to  keep  from
          conflicting with those declared as reserved words in C.
          Moreover,  structure  declarations may be produced that

          contain    conflicting    field    declarations;    and
          declarations are present for library functions that may
          not  be needed. All of these pecadillos are forgiven by
          the use of appropriate C compiler options.

          PPttcc returns success if it produces no diagnostics.
