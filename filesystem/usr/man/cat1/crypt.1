          CCrryypptt  reads  from its standard input and writes to its
          standard output, encrypting as it  goes,  according  to
          the key. CCrryypptt is its own inverse; to read an encrypted
          file, all you need to know is the key word.
          
          Note:  this  is  not  a  very  sophisticated encryption
          scheme (NSA would have it overnight).
          
          You can increase the complexity of  the  encryption  by
          using  multiple  passes of ccrryypptt,, each with a different
          keyword.

          To encrypt a file:

                ccrryypptt bbaannddeerrssnnaattcchh << ffiillee >> eennccrryypptteedd

          To read the encrypted file

                ccrryypptt bbaannddeerrssnnaattcchh << eennccrryypptteedd

          Encrypt a file with three keywords:
