          TTttyy  is  a  simple program that attempts to look up the
          full path name and number of the current  "tty"  device
          (teletypewriter  or  terminal).  Normally,  this is the
          name of the Micronix (terminal) port you logged in on.
          
          To ascertain your device number, enter the ttttyy command.
          A typical response is

               /dev/ttyB

          meaning that you are on "ttyB".
          
          If no associated file name can be  found,  the  message
          "not a tty" is printed instead.
