          AAnnaatt  translates  A-Natural narrative assembly language
          for  the  Intel  8080  to  standard  assembly  language
          acceptable   for   either  the  ISIS-II  asm80  or  the
          Microsoft Macro-80 assembler. Since the output  of  the
          8080 code generator, pp22,, is A-natural, aannaatt is required
          to  interface  the C compiler to existing 8080 software
          development facilities.
          
          The flags are:

          -i        Emit code in ISIS-II format. Identifiers have
                    each "." changed to "@" and each "_"  changed
                    to  "?".  Default is Microsoft, in which case
                    each "." is changed to "$" and  each  "_"  is
                    changed to ".".

          -o        Filename can be specified with the -o operand
                    so   that   the  output  is  written  to  the
                    specified  file  and  an  error  message   is
                    written  to  STDOUT.  Default  is  STDOUT for
                    output and STDERR for error message.

          -s        Emit an end statement. With a start  operand,
                    specifies  a  starting address. Default is no
                    start address on the end statement.


          If <files> are present, they are concatenated in  order
          and  used  as  the  input  file  instead of the default
          STDIN.
          
          If -o is absent, one or more files are present and  the
          first  filename  begins with "8", aass then behaves is if
          --oo was specified using the first filename, except  that
          the trailing "8" is changed to "m". Thus,
          
                                aannaatt ffiillee..88

          is the same as
          
                           aannaatt --oo ffiillee..mm ffiillee..88

          If   --oo   is  present,  a  name  directive  (title  for
          Microsoft) is emitted using the output file name as the
          module name; any ".suffix" in the name is stripped off.

          If there is no --oo,, but <files> are present,  the  first
          input  file  name  is  used  in  the name directive. If
          neither is preset, no name directive is emitted.
          
          Code generation begins in ccsseegg,, and reverts to ccsseegg  at
          the  end  before  any literals are emitted. Any symbols
          not defined by the end of the input file are  published
          via extrn statements at the end.
          
          
     NNOOTTEESS
          The start string used with --ss does not have "." and "_"
          mapped as identifiers.
