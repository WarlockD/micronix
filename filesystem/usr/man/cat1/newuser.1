          NNeewwuusseerr    is    largely    interactive    and   fairly
          self-explanatory.
          
          A menu-type display will ask you for the new user  name
          and  for  the name of a group to put him in. It makes a
          directory for the new user, setting the owner and group
          properly, makes a new entry in the  "/etc/passwd"  file
          and  possibly  makes  a  new  entry in the "/etc/group"
          file.

          NNeewwuusseerr is intended to make it easy to add  new  users.
          You  may  want  to  customize  your "/etc/passwd" file,
          however. NNeewwuusseerr utilizes locking, so that two newusers
          running simultaneously will  not  interfere  with  each
          other.
