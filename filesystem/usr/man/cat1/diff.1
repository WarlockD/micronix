          DDiiffff  is  a  file comparator intended for use with text
          files. It attempts to find a minimal set of differences
          between lines of the given files.
          
          Differences are reported by lines of the form
          
                  NN aa RR,,SS
                  
                  NN,,MM dd RR
                  
                  NN,,MM cc RR,,SS
                  
          Where N and M are line numbers in file1; R  and  S  are
          line numbers in file2.
          
          Following  each  line  of  this  type  is a list of the
          affected lines in file1 marked by "<" and a list of the
          affected lines in file2 marked by ">".
          
          If the --ee flag is given, the output takes the format of
          a command script for eeddiitt to change the first file into
          the second.

          There are limitations on the size of files. An "Out  of
          memory"  error message is printed if the problem is too
          large.
          
          Spurious blanks lines are sometimes generated in output
          produced under the -e option.

          means that one of the changes required is to add  lines
          after line number 4 in the first file.
          
          After the addition is done, the lines will become lines
          7 thru 9 in the second file.
