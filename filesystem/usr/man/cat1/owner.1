          Every  Micronix file has associated with it a user I.D.
          number - the "owner" of the file.
          
          The oowwnneerr utility program  allows  you  to  examine  or
          change   this   file   owner  number.  NNOOTTEE::  Only  the
          super-user may change the owner of a file.
          
          There is usually a name  for  each  user  I.D.  number.
          These   names   are   kept   in  the  system-wide  file
          "/etc/passwd."
          
          In order to discover who owns a file, type:

               oowwnneerr ffiilleennaammee

          The program will look up the  owner  of  the  file  and
          attempt  to  express  it as a user name. If this is not
          possible, it will list the owner as  a  numerical  user
          I.D.


          To change the owner of a file, type

               oowwnneerr --nneewwoowwnneerr ffiilleennaammee

          nneewwoowwnneerr  may  be  a  user  name  or a user I.D. number
          (names are recommended).
          
          The oowwnneerr program  works  equally  well  with  list  of
          files:

               oowwnneerr ffiillee11 ffiillee22 ffiillee33 ffiillee44 ffiillee55
          
          reports on the ownership of each of the named files.
