          The first named file is compressed and written onto the
          second  named  file.  If  no  file names are given, the
          standard input and output are used. If  only  one  file
          name is given, the named file is used for input and its
          compression  is  written to the standard output. If the
          second named file does not exist, it is created.

          CCoommpprreessss searches for opportunities to abbreviate  long
          runs  of  identical  characters  in an input stream. It
          encodes these into a form that the eexxppaanndd  program  can
          later  be  used  to  undo. The remainder of the file is
          merely copied through. Most text files are probably not
          worth compressing unless  they  contain  long  runs  of
          spaces. Data files, such as executable modules, benefit
          somewhat  from compression. A typical compression value
          is 7%.

          To compress a file (for disk file space saving):

     NNOOTTEESS
          Due to I/O idiosyncracies on some systems, the standard
          input and output cannot be used. The automatic addition
          of carriage returns,  etc.  in  the  input  and  output
          streams   is   unacceptable   for   this  program.  The
          construction

          should work regardless of the local environment.
