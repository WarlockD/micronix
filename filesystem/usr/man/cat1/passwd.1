          PPaasssswwdd  is  used  to  changed the login password of the
          given user.
          
          When a user's account  is  first  created,  it  has  no
          password,  that is, no password will be demanded of the
          user at log in time.
          
          This command may be used set or change  your  password.
          The  super  user  may  set or change anyone's password,
          but, not even the super user may  know  what  a  user's
          password  is.  It may, however, be changed to something
          known.
          
          This program is fairly self-explanatory and prompts you
          for the name of the user whose  password  you  want  to
          change  and  the  password  itself.  When  you type the
          password, the "echo" is temporarily turned off, so that
          the password is unseen.  Only  the  encryption  of  the
          password is kept around. If two or more users set their
          password to the same thing, the encryptions will not be
          the same.

          It   is  recommended,  if  the  intention  is  password
          security, that passwords be long, complicated, fast  to
          type, and frequently changed.
