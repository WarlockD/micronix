          The  number of characters in each of the named files is
          printed on the standard output.  If  it  would  provide
          additional  information, a total is then printed. If no
          file names are specified, or if "-" is given as a  file
          name,  the  standard input is read up to an end-of-file
          and the number of characters read is printed.

          Note: On some systems, (but not Micronix),  the  number
          of  characters  in  a file is poorly defined. There are
          sometimes two kinds of files -  text  and  binary.  The
          standard input is assumed to be a text file while files
          specified by name are assumed to be binary files.
