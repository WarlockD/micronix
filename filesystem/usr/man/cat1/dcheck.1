          DDcchheecckk  reads  the  directories  in  a  file system and
          compares the link-counts in each i-node with the number
          of directory entries by which it is referenced.
          
          
     EERRRROORRSS
          When a file turns up for which the link-count  and  the
          number  of  directory  entries  disagree,  the relevant
          facts are reported. A dangerous situation  occurs  when
          there  are  more  entries  than  links;  if entries are
          removed, the link-count drops to 0  and  the  remaining
          entries point to thin air - they should be removed.
          
          When there are more links than entries, some disk space
          may  be  wasted  but the situation is not dangerous. If
          the --ff option is given, ddcchheecckk will try to  ratify  the
          situation.
          
          
     NNOOTTEESS
          Extraneous  diagnostics  may  be  produced if ddcchheecckk is
          applied to an active file system.
