          MMkkffss  builds  an empty file system on the named device.
          If no size is specified, it determines the device  size
          automatically.  A  numerical argument _w_i_t_h_o_u_t a leading
          "-" is taken as the desired size (in 512-byte  blocks).
          A  numerical  argument _w_i_t_h a leading "-" is taken as a
          number of blocks to be excluded from the file system at
          the end of the device (say for  swap  space).  In  this
          case,   the  actual  device  size  is  also  determined
          automatically.
          
          The iilliisstt size is set to

                              ss//4433 ++ ss//11000000,, 

          where ss is the file system size determined  above.  The
          smallest practical file system is about 50 blocks.
          
          WWaarrnniinngg!!  Extreme  care should be taken when using this
          command: It _o_b_l_i_t_e_r_a_t_e_s any former file system  on  the
          device. If, for example, you entered

                              mmkkffss //ddeevv//rroooott

          you  would  have  to  rebuild  your files from scratch.
          Needless to say, aim carefully!

          The named device must be a block-special file.
