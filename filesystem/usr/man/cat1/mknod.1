          Type  is  either  b or c for block special or character
          special. Major and minor are the major and minor device
          numbers, respectively. A special file is created  (mode
          777)  with  the  given name. This call is restricted to
          the super-user.  Conventional  use  requires  that  all
          special devices be kept in the one directory, "/dev".

          Warning: it is dangerous to have to separate nodes with
          the  same  type  and  major/minor  number.  If you want
          multiple names, use llnn..
