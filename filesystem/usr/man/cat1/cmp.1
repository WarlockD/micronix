          CCmmpp  compares  two  given  files. Nothing is printed if
          they are identical. If a difference is encountered, ccmmpp
          announces the byte number and line number at which  the
          difference occurred.

          If  one  file  is an initial sub-sequence of the other,
          that fact is also noted. If the --ll option is used,  the
          byte  number  (decimal) and the differing bytes (octal)
          are printed for each difference.
