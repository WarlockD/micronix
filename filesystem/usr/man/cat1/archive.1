          AArrcchhiivvee  maintains  a  group  of  files combined into a
          single archive file. The archiver has  good  protection
          against  data  loss  through  disk  overflow  and works
          equally well with text and non-text  files  (for  those
          systems on which there is a distinction).

          Exactly one key character must be specified to indicate
          which action you wish aarrcchhiivvee to perform.
          
          The meanings of the key characters are:


          d         Delete the named files from the archive file.
                    If  no  names  are  given, the archive is not
                    altered.

          p         Print  the  named  files  in   the   archive.
                    Non-printing characters are filtered out.

          t         Print  a  table  of  contents  of the archive
                    file. If no names are given, all files in the
                    archive are tabled. If names are given,  only
                    those files are tabled.

          u         Update the named files in the archive. If the
                    named  archive does not exist, it is created.
                    If no names  are  given,  all  files  in  the
                    archive are updated. If a name is given which
                    is not in the archive, a new archive entry is
                    created and its contents becomes the contents
                    of the named file. Otherwise, the contents of
                    archive's  entry is replaced with the current
                    version of the file.

          x         Extract the named files.  The  files  in  the
                    archive  are  copied out to ordinary files of
                    the same name. The  former  contents  of  the
                    ordinary files are destroyed. If no names are
                    given,   all   files   in   the  archive  are
                    extracted. In neither case does x  alter  the
                    archive.
