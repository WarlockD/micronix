          EEnnttaabb  acts  as a filter, copying the standard input to
          the standard output unchanged with the  exception  that
          groups  of blanks are replaced by a tab where possible.
          EEnnttaabb  assumes  tabs  are  every  eight  positions,  at
          columns 9, 17, 25, etc. EEnnttaabb is useful for speeding up
          printing  and  communication  over  slow  paths,  or to
          effect file compression. DDeettaabb is its inverse.
