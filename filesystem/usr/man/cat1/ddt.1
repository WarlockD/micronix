          DDddtt  can be a handy tool for programmers and others who
          need to  manipulate  arbitrary  (i.e.  non-ASCII  text)
          files.
          
          It  is  functionally  analogous  to CP/M's DDT, but the
          Digital Research version works with memory, while  this
          one works on files.
          
          Changes  made  to  a  file  under  ddddtt  are immediately
          effective. There is no intermediate buffer as with some
          editors.
          
          Addresses (mentioned below) are given  in  hexadecimal,
          (up  to  six digits long). If the first character of an
          address is an '' (apostrophe), the value of that  number
          will be that of the ASCII character following.
          
          
          The following are valid addresses:

          00     66       bb       BB       ''yy      
          cc33bb00  7788bbaa44  ''AA      FFFFFFFF     ''//

          Address list may be comma-separated or space-separated.
          
          The following are valid address lists:

          00,,ffffffff        00,,55,,77   00,,33000000,,''aa       ''aa,,''bb,,''cc

          No  command  takes  more  than  three  addresses. Extra
          addresses are ignored.

          DDddtt always remembers the last file address accessed. In
          most cases, if you give no address on the next command,
          this old remembered address is used.

          Commands:

       dd -- ddiissppllaayy

          Takes 0, 1, or 2 arguments. Displays  the  contents  of
          the  file in hex bytes on the left and ASCII characters
          on the right. If no address follows  dd,,  the  next  128
          bytes, starting at the given location, are displayed.
          
          Finally,  if  two addresses are given, that part of the
          file which lies between the two addresses is displayed.
          
          Examples:

                dd 00,, ffffffff

                dd

                dd 5555

                dd aa000000


       ff -- ffiillll ((rreeqquuiirreess tthhrreeee aarrgguummeennttss))

       ff AA,, BB,, CC

          The portion of the file which lies between addresses  A
          and  B  (inclusive)  is overwritten with a flood of the
          charac Repacking the units in their original  container
          provides the best protection during shipping.
          
           -  Enclosed  in  the Decision I box is a contents list
          for the
              system you have ordered.  This  list  contains  the
          serial num
              bers  of  all  devices in your system. Please check
          the contents
              of the the containers to verify all components have
          been re
              ceived. Most systems are shipped in more  than  one
          container,
              but  the  Decision I box always contains the system
          contents
              dsubstitute  command  allows  you  to  examine  and
          optionallly  change  the  file on a byte-by-byte basis.
          After entering the ssuubbssttiittuuttee command you  will  be  in
          "substitute"  mode  until  you  exit  it  by entering a
          single period on a line. If  while  in  the  substitute
          mode  you  press  RETURN,  the byte you were looking at
          will remain unchanged and you will be  stepped  to  the
          next  byte.  If  you  enter  a byte value and then push
          RETURN, the byte will be changed to the byte entered.

       // ((aaddddrreessss))
       //// ((sseeaarrcchh))

          DDddtt has the ability to search for patterns in  a  file.
          When  the  "/"  command  is given, you will be asked to
          enter a series of bytes to search for.  If  an  address
          follows  the  "/",  the  search  commences at the given
          address in the file. Without  an  address,  the  search
          commences at the current file address.
          
          The "//" command is a shorthand to search again for the
          previously given pattern.
