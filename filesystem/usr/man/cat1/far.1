          FFaarr   provides   a  simple  interface  to  CP/M  floppy
          diskettes. Device is  assumed  to  be  the  name  of  a
          Micronix  special  file (such as /dev/fla) containing a
          CP/M  diskette.  Names  such   as   /dev/fla   may   be
          abbreviated as fla.
          
          The flags are:
          
          --dd        DDeelleettee..  Delete  the  named  files  from  the
                    floppy diskette. If no file names are  given,
                    no action is taken.
                    
          --pp        PPrriinntt..
                    Each named file is sent to the standard output.   
                    
          --rr        RReeppllaaccee..  Each  named  file  is copied _t_o the
                    floppy. If no file names are given, no action
                    is taken. If a file  already  exists  on  the
                    floppy, it is silently overwritten.
                    
          --tt        TTaabbllee..  Print  a  table  of  contents  of the
                    floppy diskette. If any files are named, only
                    those named and present are listed.
                    
          --xx        EExxttrraacctt.. Each named file is copied  _f_r_o_m  the
                    diskette  _t_o  the current Micronix directory.
                    If  no  file  names  are  given,  _t_h_e  _e_n_t_i_r_e
                    _c_o_n_t_e_n_t_s of the diskette is extracted.
                    
          --vv        VVeerrbboossee..  Be verbose about it. Each operation
                    is printed along with the affected file name.
                    Files deleted are preceded by  a  "d",  those
                    replaced   are  preceded  by  an  "r",  those
                    extracted are preceded by "x".
                    
          At most, one of the flags  -  dd,,  tt,,  rr,,  xx  -  may  be
          present. If none are present, --tt is assumed.
          
          The  file  list may contain wild card matching patterns
          to be applied to the set of  file  names  in  the  CP/M
          diskette's directory.
          
          The  rules  for file name matching patterns are exactly
          the same as those for the shell (see sh (I)).

          You receive a new CP/M software package in the mail  on
          diskette and want to run it under Micronix.


          To  copy  its contents to Micronix, insert the diskette
          into floppy drive A and type:
          
                                ffaarr ffllaa --xxvv
          
          To copy a file from a diskette, changing  its  name  in
          the process:
          
                       ffaarr ddjjaa --pp ffiilleennaammee >> nneewwnnaammee
          
          
          To  copy  only  the  ".doc"  files  over  from  a  CP/M
          mini-floppy:
          
                            ffaarr mmffaa --xxvv ""**..ddoocc""
