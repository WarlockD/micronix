          CCxxrr  generates  a C cross reference listing for each of
          the named files. If an argument begins  with  a  minus,
          the  rest  of the argument is taken as the name of file
          containing  symbols  to  be  excluded  from  the  cross
          referencing. The symbols found therein are added to the
          list  of  already excluded symbols. The exclusion files
          are free form. The symbols may appear most anywhere, as
          long  as  they  are   separated   by   non-alphanumeric
          characters.  Note that the output of ccxxrr is in order of
          appearance. For a  useful  listing,  run  ccxxrr''ss  output
          through  ssoorrtt..  If  no  cross reference input files are
          given, the standard input is used. For each symbol, the
          following is printed:

                  <<ssyymmbbooll>> <<ffiillee>> <<ffuunnccttiioonn>> <<lliinnee>> <<ccoonntteexxtt>>

          where

                  <<ssyymmbbooll>>

          is simply the name of the symbol.
          
                  <<ffiillee>>

          is the name of the file in which the  current  instance
          of  the symbol occurs; <file> is used when the standard
          input is being used.
          
                  <<ffuunnccttiioonn>>

          is the name  of  the  function  in  which  the  current
          instance  of  the  symbol  appears.  If  the  symbol is
          global, no function name is printed.

                  <<lliinnee>>

          is the number of the file.
          
                  <<ccoonntteexxtt>>

          is the text of the line in which the  current  instance
          of  the  symbol appears. Leading white space is removed
          from the line before printing.
