          Associated  with  each Micronix file is a group number.
          The group number is  used  to  determine  group  access
          permission. If you are running a single user, informal,
          or  very  low user-population system, the whole concept
          of groups may be irrelevant to you.
          
          The ggrroouupp command can be used to view the  group  names
          of  files.  The  relationship  of  group names to group
          numbers   is   entirely   established   by   the   file
          "/etc/group" [see ggrroouupp (5)].

          GGrroouupp prints the group name for each file given. If the
          file's  group  number  has no name, the group number is
          printed in decimal instead.
          
          If the first argument to ggrroouupp is a group name preceded
          by a hyphen, ggrroouupp attempts to change the group of each
          of the named files to the given name.
