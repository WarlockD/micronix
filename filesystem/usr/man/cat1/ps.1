          PPss prints information about processes currently running
          on the system.
          
          Any  user  is  allowed  to  know the command name other
          users are running. The actual data being  processed  is
          not a matter of public record, however.

          PPss can be very useful in tracking down errant processes
          and terminating them.

          Options:


          a    All.   Print   information   about  all  processes
               associated with a terminal.

          l    Long format. Print detailed  information  on  each
               process.

          x    Print   information   about   all   processes  not
               associated with a terminal.

          
          The following is a description of each possible  column
          in the output from ppss..


          STATE  represents  the  current  state  of the program.
          Within the state field the following flags may show up:

          Al   Alive. The process has not yet terminated.

          Aw   Awake. The process is not waiting for a slow event
               and may be run immediately.

          Ld   Loaded. The process has been loaded into memory.

          Lk   Locked. The image of  this  process  is  currently
               locked in main memory.

          Sw   Swapped.  The  image  of  this  process  currently
               resides on the swap device.

          Sy   System. This process is in its system phase.

          To kill your runaway process from another terminal:

          1)   Log in.

          2)   Type "ps".

          3)   Locate  the  process  of interest in the resulting
               printout.

          4)   Type "kill process ID number"; ex: "kill 7"
