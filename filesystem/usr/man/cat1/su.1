          SSuu  allows  you  to  change  your  effective user ID in
          midstream so to speak.
          
          The most common use of this program is  to  temporarily
          become  a  super-user  in  order  to install a program,
          change a system-wide file, kill off an  errant  process
          or other administrative task.
          
          If no name is given, "root" is the default.
          
          Non super users will be asked to give passwords.
