          IInniitt  creates an automatic process for each terminal on
          a which a user may log in.
          
          IInniitt first brings the system up  in  single-user  mode,
          with only the console active. If there is a password on
          the  "root" account, it demands this first. (Therefore,
          it is a good idea to keep a Micronix diskette  with  an
          unprotected  root account, in case the root password is
          lost.)
          
          When the single user shell exits, iinniitt runs  the  shell
          script  "/etc/rc"  if  it  exists,  then reads the file
          "/etc/ttys", and branches several  times  to  create  a
          process for each terminal specified in the file.
          
          When  one  of  init's child processes terminates, a new
          process is generated to take its place. Normally,  this
          takes place automatically.
          
          The  format  of the "/etc/tty" file is as follows, (one
          per line):
                        ttttyy AA ((99660000)) ((oonn)) ((sshhaakkee))
