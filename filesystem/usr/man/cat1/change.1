          CChhaannggee  reads  the standard input up to an end-of-file.
          It writes the standard output exactly as it  was  read,
          except  that  all  instances  of the regular expression
          ffrroomm are replaced with ttoo.. If no replacement pattern is
          specified, all instances of the regular expression  are
          eliminated.  The  rules  for  regular  expressions  and
          replacement patterns are exactly as in eeddiitt..
