          Each  of the named files is removed, if possible. It is
          also used also to remove  directories;  files  must  be
          removed first, however.
          
          The -r option removes entire hierarchies of files. This
          means all files, subdirectories, directories, etc. will
          be  permanently erased, which means that this option is
          quite _d_a_n_g_e_r_o_u_s! When run interactively,  this  program
          asks  if  it  may  proceed  with the requests, however,
          offering some amount of  protection,  but  still,  take
          care when using this command.

          It is not possible to remove non-empty directories.
