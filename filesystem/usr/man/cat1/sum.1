          SSuumm computes and prints a check sum and block count for
          each  named  file.  (Blocks  are 512 bytes long.) If no
          file names are given, it computes a check sum  for  the
          standard input.

          If  the -r option is used, ssuumm recursively descends the
          file hierarchy,  summing  each  file  as  it  goes.  In
          recursive  mode,  special files and directories are not
          summed.
          
          As an example, check sums can be  used  to  verify  the
          integrity  of  a  file  over the phone. Sums are in the
          range 0 to 65,535. If two files  have  identical  check
          sums, it is quite likely that they are identical.
