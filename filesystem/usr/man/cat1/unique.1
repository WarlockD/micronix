          UUnniiqquuee reads the standard input and writes the standard
          output.  All  but one of each set of adjacent duplicate
          lines are eliminated. Otherwise,  the  text  is  copied
          through  unchanged.  If the --nn option is given, a count
          of the number of duplicates of  each  line  is  printed
          along with the text of the line.

          To eliminate all duplicate lines in a file:

                  ssoorrtt <<ffiillee >>tteemmpp

     NNOOTTEESS
          In order to assure adjacency, the file in question must
          be presorted.
