          DDcc is a stack-oriented desk calculator allowing integer
          arithmetic and conversion. Its operation is much like a
          Reverse   Polish  Notation  calculator.  It  reads  the
          standard input and writes  the  standard  output.  Each
          token is processed as soon as it is read; ?? is the only
          error  diagnostic.  The  following  is  a  list  of the
          tokens, their meanings, and the action ddcc will take.
          
          <<nnuummbbeerr>>

               A number. The  number  is  pushed  on  the  stack,
               (i.e.,  remembered).  A  number  must begin with a
               digit or a minus sign followed  by  a  digit.  For
               example, to input ten in base sixteen, type 00aa..


          ''<<cchhaarraacctteerr>>

               An apostrophe followed by a character is converted
               to  that  character's  ASCII value and pushed onto
               the stack.


          ++,, --,, **,, //,, %%,, &&,, ||,, ^^,, <<,, >>

               These are the binary operators. The top two values
               on the stack are combined. Division by zero is not
               permitted. If a binary operation is attempted with
               fewer than two numbers in the stack, an error will
               result.

               The  following  are  the   operators   and   their
               meanings.

          ~         The   top  value  on  the  stack  is  bitwise
                    inverted. It is an error for the stack to  be
                    empty.

          i         Set  the  input radix. The input radix is set
                    to the value on the top of the stack.  Values
                    less  than  2 are not accepted. Values larger
                    than 36 are  liable  to  cause  garbage.  All
                    further  input  is  assumed  to be in the new
                    radix.

          o         Set the output radix, as above.

          p         Print the value on the top of the stack.

          c         Clear. The stack is emptied.
