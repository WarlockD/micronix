          LLiibb  performs  all  functions  necessary  to  build and
          maintain object module libraries. It can also  be  used
          to  collect  arbitrary  files into one bucket. LLffiillee is
          the name of an existing library file or, in the case of
          replace (-r), the name of the library to be created.
          
          The flags are:
          
          -d        Delete the zero or more named files from  the
                    library.
                    
          -r        Replace  the  zero  or more named files in an
                    existing library  or,  if  no  library  llffiillee
                    exists, create a library with the named files
                    in the specified order.
                    
                    Named  files  that  are  not  present  in the
                    library are appended to the end in the  order
                    specified.
                    
          -t        Lists  files in the library in the order they
                    occur. If any files  are  named,  only  those
                    named and present are listed.
                    
          -x        Extract  any  named files that are present in
                    the library into files of the same  name.  If
                    no files are named, all files are extracted.
                    
          -v        Be   verbose   about   it.   Files   retained
                    unmodified are each listed with  a  preceding
                    "c".  Those  deleted  are  preceded by a "d",
                    those replaced are preceded  by  an  "r"  and
                    those  appended to the end are preceded by an
                    "a". For the --tt option, each file  is  listed
                    with its length in bytes.
                    
          -6        Create  a file with UNIX v. 6 format, if none
                    exists. Effective only with --rr..
                    
          -7        Create a file with UNIX v. 7 format, if  none
                    exists. Effective only with --rr..

          At  most,  one  of  the flags [drtx] may be present. If
          none are present, --tt is assumed. Similarly, at most one
          of the flags  [67]  should  be  present.  If  none  are
          present,  Whitesmith's  library  file format is assumed
          when a new library is created by --rr..
          
          The Whitesmith's library format consists of a  two-byte
          header   having   the   value   0177565,  written  less
          significant  byte  first,  followed  by  zero  or  more
          entries.
          
          Each  entry  consists of a fourteen-byte name, followed
          by a two-byte unsigned file length,  also  stored  less
          significant  byte  first, followed by the file contents
          proper. If a name begins with a null byte, it is  taken
          as the end of the library file.
          
          Note  that this differs in several small ways from UNIX
          v.  6  format,  which  has  a  header  of  0177555,  an
          eight-byte   name,  six  bytes  of  miscellaneous  UNIX
          specific file attributes, and a two-byte  file  length.
          Moreover,  a  file whose length is odd is followed by a
          null padding byte in the UNIX format, but no padding is
          used in standard library format.
          
          UNIX  v.7  format  is  characterized  by  a  header  of
          0177545,  a  fourteen-byte  name,  six  bytes  of  UNIX
          specific file attributes, and a four-byte  length.  Odd
          length files are also padded to even.
          
          
     RREETTUURRNNSS
          LLiibb  returns  success  if  no problems are encountered,
          else failure. In most failures,  an  error  message  is
          printed to STDERR and the library file is not modified.
          Output  from  the  --tt  flag,  and  verbose remarks, are
          written to STDERR.
          
          
     EEXXAAMMPPLLEE
          To build a library and check its contents:

     NNOOTTEESS
          If all files are deleted from a  library,  a  vestigial
          file  remains.  Modifying  UNIX  v.6 or UNIX v.7 format
          files causes all attributes of all file entries  to  be
          zeroed.
          
          It does not check for large files (over 65534 bytes).
