          The  number  of  words  in  each  of the named files is
          printed alongside the file name. If no file  names  are
          specified,  or  if  "-"  is  given  as a file name, the
          standard input is read up to  an  end-of-file  and  the
          number  of  words  encountered  is  printed.  A word is
          defined as a contiguous string of non-blanks  separated
          by  blanks  characters.  A  blank  is  a space, tab, or
          newline character.
