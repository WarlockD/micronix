          EExxppaanndd  reverses the effects of ccoommpprreessss.. EExxppaanndd is not
          guaranteed to do anything sensible with input which  is
          not  the result of a ccoommpprreessss run. The first named file
          is expanded and written into the second named file.  If
          no  file names are given, standard input and output are
          used. If only one file name is given, the named file is
          used for input, and its expansion  is  written  to  the
          standard output.
