          The  system  call  at the location syscall is executed.
          Execution resumes after the iinnddiirr call.
          
          The main purpose of  iinnddiirr  is  to  allow  programs  to
          construct system calls in their data segments, avoiding
          modifications to their code.
          
          The  system  call  at syscall must begin with the "sys"
          byte. An iinnddiirr executed indirectly is a no-op.

          The returns depend on the indirectly executed call.
