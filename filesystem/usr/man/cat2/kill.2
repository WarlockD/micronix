     NNAAMMEE
          kkiillll - signal a process

          KKiillll  sends  the  signal,  sig, to the process with the
          given ID. The usual effect is to kill the process - see
          ssiiggnnaall (2) for a discussion and a list of signals.
          
          The sending and receiving processes must have the  same
          effective   user   IDs,  or  the  sender  must  be  the
          super-user.
          
          If the given process ID is 0, then the signal  is  sent
          to all other processes with the same controlling tty.
          
          A process can never kill itself.
