          This  call  waits  for  the  termination  of any of the
          caller's children. If any child has died since the last
          wait, return is immediate. If there are no children, an
          error is  returned.  If  there  are  several  children,
          several  wait  calls  are necessary to learn of all the
          deaths.
          
          Wait returns the process ID of  the  terminated  child,
          and   fills  in  the  user-supplied  integer  with  the
          termination status. In the case of a normal termination
          via eexxiitt,, the low byte of the status is 0, and the high
          byte is the low byte of the child's exit  argument.  In
          the  case  of a signal-caused termination, the low byte
          of the status is the signal number, and the  high  byte
          is the child's l register.
          
          If  a parent process terminates without waiting for its
          children, the initialization process (process id  =  1)
          inherits the children.

          A  positive  number  indicates  success, a -1 indicates
          failure  (no  children).  On  success,  the  pointed-to
          status  is  filled  in  with  the  child's  termination
          status, and the child's process ID is returned.

          The carry flag is cleared on success, or set on failure
          (no children). On success, the child's  process  ID  is
          returned  in hl, and its termination status is returned
          in de.
