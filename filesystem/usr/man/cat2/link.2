          A link to "old" is created, with the name "new". Either
          name may be an arbitrary pathname.
          
          "New"  must  not  already  exist, its directory must be
          writable, and it must be on the same device  as  "old".
          "Old"  must  not be a directory (unless the user is the
          super-user), and must not have more than 254 links.
