          The  "nice"  of  a  process  is  the  opposite  of  its
          intuitive "priority" -- the "nicer" it is, the less cpu
          time it hogs. This systen entry sets the  nice  of  the
          calling  process  to  the  given  argument. Nice values
          range from -128 to 127; the normal value is 0. Only the
          super-user can set a negative nice (== high  priority).
          Long  running  background  programs  should be run at a
          positive nice as a favor to other users.
          
          A process' nice is passed to its children via the  ffoorrkk
          system call.
