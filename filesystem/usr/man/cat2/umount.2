          UUmmoouunntt  tells  the  system  that the given special file
          should no longer be treated as a file system. The  file
          on which the device was mounted reverts to its ordinary
          interpretation.
          
          UUmmoouunntt  will  return  an  error  if there are still any
          active files on the mounted system.
