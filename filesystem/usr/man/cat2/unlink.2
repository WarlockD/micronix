          UUnnlliinnkk  removes the indicated entry from its directory.
          If this was the last link to  the  file,  the  file  is
          removed and its space is freed. If the file was open in
          any  process, this removal is delayed until the file is
          closed,  even  though  its  last  directory  entry  has
          disappeared.
          
          In  order  to  unlink  a  file,  a user must have write
          permission on its directory. Write  permission  is  not
          required  on  the  file itself. Only the super-user can
          unlink a directory.
