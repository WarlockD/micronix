          MMkknnoodd  creates a new file. Unlike ccrreeaatt,, it may be used
          to create directories and special files;  it  does  not
          truncate or open files.
          
          The mode of the new file (including the file type bits)
          is  taken from the mode argument, and the first address
          is taken  from  addr.  For  directories,  this  address
          should  be  0, while for special files it should be the
          device number.
          
          This call is restricted to the super-user.

          failure.
