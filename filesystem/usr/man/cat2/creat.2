          ccrreeaatt - create a new file (or truncate an old one)


     CC
          creat(name, mode)
          char *name;

          If the file does not exist, and if the parent directory
          is  writable, it is created with the given mode. If the
          file does exist and is writable, it is truncated  to  0
          length,  and  its  mode  and owner remain unchanged. In
          either case, the file is opened for writing only, and a
          file descriptor is returned.
          
          See cchhmmoodd (2) for the construction of modes. Note  that
          the  file is opened for writing, even if the given mode
          does not allow writing. This can be used as  a  locking
          mechanism,  in that another program will not be able to
          create the same file.
          
          CCrreeaatt is subject to the limit  of  16  open  files  per
          process.

          CCrreeaatt(())  returns  a  file descriptor (a small, positive
          number) on success, or a -1 on failure.

          The carry  flag  is  cleared  on  success,  or  set  on
          failure.  If  successful, a file descriptor is returned
          in hl.
