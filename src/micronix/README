this directory and subdirectories contain native sources for
micronix as modernized and modified. many of the sources are
recovered from disassembly and grunging through a variety of
old floppies. yet others are ported from Bell Labs v6 and V7.

there are 3 makefiles:

Makefile:  used by the old make to bootstrap the new tools

makefile:  used to build the new tools

GNUmakefile: used when outside the simulator
