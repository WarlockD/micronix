it's a good idea to keep these executables under 4k, because micronix
loads at 0x1000.

in a pinch, the boot code could put all buffers except the indirect
block into a non-loaded BSS above 4k; that will gain 512 bytes.

this directory contains the standalone and cp/m boot programs
for the djdma and hddma controllers
