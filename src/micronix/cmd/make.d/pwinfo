Differences between PW make & original make:
-  If exit status is ignored for an executed command,
   a warning is not printed if the command returns a non-zero status.
   The original prints such a warning.
-  When the command is printed prior to execution,
   the command name is prefixed with ">";  this makes the commands stand out.
-  Has builtin suffix rules for LEAP script .t-.o files, and .z-.h files.
-  After reading internal "makerules" file,
   but before reading the local "makefile" file,
   PW version reads "makecomm"/"Makecomm"in login directory,
   and then in local directory.
   "makecomm" is useful for defining "common" macro names.
-  PW version exec's commands by using pexec(), which uses the .path file.
