1) generalize commands

the real vi does things like wipe, yank, delete, indent, etc
with a following key that is a movement command.  so >} should
indent the next block. doubling the command is shortcut for the line.
so dd is delete line 
   >> is indent line

so, instead of all the special case code in normal.c that looks at the
next character literally and then has brute force code, these commands
should set a marker, do the movement, and then apply the operator between
the marker and the cursor.

2) read modeline at end of file to set tabstop
