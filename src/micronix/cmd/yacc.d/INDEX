The archive file contains information for testing and installing
Version 2 of Yacc.  The programs require the -lS library.

Cat yaccdiffs for a brief description of the differences
between version 2 of yacc and earlier versions.

To install a command called yacc in the same directory
as the yacc.a file, do
	ar x yacc.a
This yacc command must be run with the current directory 
equal to the directory containing the yacc.a files.
	sh -v <tmake

To install a version of yacc as a system command,
it is necessary to provide an installation dependent
version of the file "files", called myfiles.
This should contain macro definitions for
absolute file names for the three parser files.
If the filenames /usr/lib/yacc[eor]par are acceptable,
the file instfiles can be copied to myfiles;
otherwise, the file instfiles should be read and
changed.  The parsers should be copied to the indicated
locations.

The command
	sh -v <install
then compiles a program called yacc which can be
run in any directory and refers to the absolute
path names for the parsers given in myfiles.
This can be copied to /usr/bin/yacc after running
any local tests you wish.

If this process does not compile due to the lack of macros
"isdigit", "isupper", and "islower" on the standard library
<stdio.h>, append the file "macros" to the tfile and
myfile files.
