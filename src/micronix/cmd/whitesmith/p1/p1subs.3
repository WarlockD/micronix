[1mFUNCTION[0m
     plsubs.c contains subroutines used throughout p1 and roughly
     fall into the following categories: boundary and size calcu‚Äê
     lations; buying space for symbols, attributes, etc; and type
     testing and setting.

     bndify, bound, and bytes form the functions which  take  the
     boundary  and  sizes of declarators.  They use bndtab, bytab
     in plconf.c and typtab locally to correlate basic  types  to
     boundaries  and sizes.  bndify enforces boundaries in struc‚Äê
     tures and on the  stack  among  autos.   bound  returns  the
     boundary  of the basic type or recurses on the next type for
     an array, or takes the strongest  boundary  requirement  for
     structure or union.

     bytes  takes  the size of a declaration, and returns it as a
     long.  For a basic type, it looks it up in bytab.   For  ar‚Äê
     rays,  multiply the attribute a.m (number of elements) times
     the next type down.  For a structure, find the last element,
     calculate  its  size, add its offset and then calculate cor‚Äê
     rect boundary.  If none of the above, the type is assured to
     be  function,  for  which  bytes is an incorrect function to
     have called.

     buymat, buyop,  buysat,  buysym,  buyterm,  clrsym,  cgytok,
     lname, lookup, maxty, setad, setty are all utilities used in
     a number of places and whose operation is obvious.

     dety picks a complex type field off of the  ty  entry.   The
     complex  entries  are  PTRTO, ARRAY, and FNRST, all of which
     are represented in two bits; so that right shifting two bits
     and masking for sign extension does the job.

     dlit  returns  the  literal  table entry (built by expr) for
     double literals or NULL.

     dtype, itype, ptype and stype are booleans returning whether
     a  declaration  ia  respectively double, integer, pointer or
     scalar.

     retype adds a complex type specification to the current dec‚Äê
     laration  more  then  five specifications in addition to the
     basic type is an error.

     type returns the current type specifier of  the  declaration
     in question.  If the type is basic, neither of the lower or‚Äê
     der two bits will be set, otherwise one or both will be set.

     fixlint is called by main to convert tables so that ints are
     longs, not shorts as is the default.
