     p1puts.c  puts  commands and expression trees from p1 to p2.
     The commands and tree formats are described in int12.h.

     THe zero term, zeterm, is a handy term to  have  around  for
     moving zero into an expression.

     xtab is a table which maps the types used in p1, typtab, in‚Äê
     to types used by p2.  Used by ptexpr.

     relops, reflip, and jctab are tables whcih map the relation‚Äê
     al operators (relops, reflip) into operators (jctab) for p2.
     pjc, pjf, pjt use the tables.

     nextsym, the created label number, starts at ‚Äê1, and is  in‚Äê
     cremented by two in crs() before return.  Thus, created sym‚Äê
     bols from p1 begin at 1 and are odd.

     lblname makes a label number (short), into a printable char‚Äê
     acter string.  The character string begins with a ‚Äô>‚Äô and is
     mapped backwards from the integer, such  that  0123  becomes
     ">321".   This  must  match a similar algorithm in p2, since
     sometimes labels are passed both by name and  by  value  for
     later matchup.

     pend  walks  the littab (LITERAL) table, and for each double
     or string constant which is defined and used (p‚Äê>sc not  ze‚Äê
     ro) puts it to p2.

     pjc puts conditional jumps to p2.  It maps relational opera‚Äê
     tions into p2 operator commands, puts the label to jump  and
     puts  the  left  and right expressions which are compared by
     the operator.

     pjf and pjt are responsible for putting jump  on  false  and
     jump  on  true  expressions, including &&, || and NOT opera‚Äê
     tors.  To outline pjf:

        if no expression to test
                return false branch
        else if (&&)
                false branch = recurse (pjf) or left side
                return label created by recursing on right side
        else if (||)
                true branch = recurse (pft) on left side
                return label created by recursing on right side
        else if (NOT)
                return recurse on pjt
        else if a relational
                put a jump conditional flipping operator
        else
                put a jump conditioanl of operator EQUAL vs. the zeterm

     pmove builds a gets operator into a term, given the left and
     right  side,  and must typify the term before putting it to
     p2.

     pswtab puts the branch table used by  switch  code.   First,
     the  label  of the switch table is put, followed by pairs of
     label addresses and case values.  Finally the default label,
     value are put.

     pvoid,  which  is  the  conduit for expressions to p2, first
     calls docheck, to check whether the expression  is  meaning‚Äê
     ful.

     rbuy buys a register of the allocatable set for use within a
     function.  The expressions:

        *pset = set & (set ‚Äê 1);
                return (get ^ *pset);

     returns the rightmost element of a set and removes  it  from
     the set.
