[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
     rel <flags> <files>

[1mFUNCTION[0m
     rel  permits inspection of the relocatable binary files pro‐
     duced by the assembler as or by the loader ld11.  It can  be
     used simply to check for defined or undefined symbols, or to
     check module sizes.

     The flags are:
     [1m‐d                         [22mList all defined symbols in  each
          file, along with the value of the symbol, in octal, and
          the code ’T’ for text relative, ’D’ for data  relative,
          ’B’  for  bss relative, ’A’ for absolute, ’F’ for file‐
          names, or ’?’  for anything else it doesn’t  recognize.
          Lower  case  letters  are used for local symbols, upper
          case for globals.
     [1m‐i                         [22mPrint global entries with  inter‐
          vals  shown  in the value field.  ‐i implies sorting by
          value plus the ‐d and ‐u flags.
     [1m‐s                         [22mDisplay the sizes, in decimal, of
          the  text  segment,  the data segment, the bss segment,
          and the sum of both segments.
     [1m‐u                         [22mList  all  undefined  symbols  in
          each  file.   If  ‐d  is  also specified, the symbol is
          listed with the code ’U’; its value is  the  space  re‐
          quired.
     [1m‐v                          [22mSort  by  value,  implies the ‐d
          flag above.  If the values match  then  the  names  are
          used.

     If  no  flags  are given, the default is ‐du, i.e. a list of
     all symbols with their values is given, in alphabetical  or‐
     der  by symbol name.  If multiple options are given, the or‐
     der of output is 1) the segment sizes called for by  ‐s,  2)
     the symbol list called for by ‐d and/or ‐u.

     <files> specifies zero or more files, which must be in relo‐
     catable format.  If more than one file  is  specified,  then
     the output for each is preceded by a line of the form

        file:

     and  if  ‐s  is present a total line is also printed.  If no
     files are specified, or if ’‐’ is encountered on the command
     line, "a.out" is used.

[1mRETURNS[0m
     rel  returns success if no diagnostics are produced, i.e. if
     all reads are successful and all file formats are valid.
[1mEXAMPLE[0m

     To obtain a list of undefined symbols:

     % rel ‐u mesg.o

     which might look like:

     _chmod
     _cpybuf
     _devname
     _fstat
     c~ret
     c~sav
