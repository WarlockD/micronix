     PROGRAM
          lib ‐ maintains Whitesmith’s format libraries


     USAGE
          lib lfile [flags] [files]


     FUNCTION
          Lib performs all functions necessary to build and main‐
          tain object module libraries.  It can also be  used  to
          collect  arbitrary files into one bucket.  Lfile is the
          name of an existing library file or, in the case of re‐
          place (‐r), the name of the library to be created.

          The flags are:

          ‐d        Delete  the zero or more named files from the
                    library.

          ‐r        Replace the zero or more named  files  in  an
                    existing  library or, if no library lfile ex‐
                    ists, create a library with the  named  files
                    in the specified order.

                    Named  files  that are not present in the li‐
                    brary are appended to the end  in  the  order
                    specified.

          ‐t        Lists  files in the library in the order they
                    occur.  If any files are  named,  only  those
                    named and present are listed.

          ‐x        Extract  any  named files that are present in
                    the library into files of the same name.   If
                    no files are named, all files are extracted.

          ‐v        Be  verbose about it.  Files retained unmodi‐
                    fied are each listed with  a  preceding  "c".
                    Those  deleted  are  preceded by a "d", those
                    replaced are preceded by an "r" and those ap‐
                    pended  to  the  end  are preceded by an "a".
                    For the ‐t option, each file is  listed  with
                    its length in bytes.

          ‐6        Create  a file with UNIX v. 6 format, if none
                    exists. Effective only with ‐r.

          ‐7        Create a file with UNIX v. 7 format, if  none
                    exists.  Effective only with ‐r.
















          At  most,  one  of the flags [drtx] may be present.  If
          none are present, ‐t is assumed.   Similarly,  at  most
          one  of  the flags [67] should be present.  If none are
          present, Whitesmith’s library file  format  is  assumed
          when a new library is created by ‐r.

          The  Whitesmith’s library format consists of a two‐byte
          header having the value 0177565, written less  signifi‐
          cant byte first, followed by zero or more entries.

          Each  entry  consists of a fourteen‐byte name, followed
          by a two‐byte unsigned file length,  also  stored  less
          significant  byte  first, followed by the file contents
          proper.  If a name begins with a null byte, it is taken
          as the end of the library file.

          Note  that this differs in several small ways from UNIX
          v. 6 format, which has a header of 0177555,  an  eight‐
          byte  name,  six  bytes  of miscellaneous UNIX specific
          file attributes, and a two‐byte file length.  Moreover,
          a  file  whose length is odd is followed by a null pad‐
          ding byte in the UNIX format, but no padding is used in
          standard library format.

          UNIX  v.7  format  is  characterized  by  a  header  of
          0177545, a fourteen‐byte name, six bytes of  UNIX  spe‐
          cific  file  attributes,  and  a four‐byte length.  Odd
          length files are also padded to even.


     RETURNS
          Lib returns success if  no  problems  are  encountered,
          else  failure.   In  most failures, an error message is
          printed to STDERR and the library file is not modified.
          Output from the ‐t flag, and verbose remarks, are writ‐
          ten to STDERR.


     EXAMPLE
          To build a library and check its contents:

                  lib clib ‐r one.o two.o three.o

                  lib clb ‐tv






















     NOTES
          If all files are deleted from a  library,  a  vestigial
          file  remains.   Modifying  UNIX v.6 or UNIX v.7 format
          files causes all attributes of all file entries  to  be
          zeroed.

          It does not check for large files  (over 65534 bytes).
