     [1mdis80 [22m‐ translate A‐Natural relocatable files

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
     dis80 ‐[c i] <files>

[1mFUNCTION[0m
     dis80  permits  translation to symbolic form of the relocat‐
     able binary files produced by the A‐Natural assembler as.80.
     This  form  is compatible with existing assembler code on an
     8080.

     The flags are:

     [1m‐c [22mTranslate each file to an assembler program suitable  for
          input  to the Microsoft assembler under CP/M.  Each un‐
          derscore ’_’ in an identifier is changed  to  ’.’,  and
          each ’.’ is changed to ’$’.

     [1m‐i  [22mTranslate each file to an assembler program suitable for
          input to the asm80 assembler under ISIS‐II.   Each  un‐
          derscore  ’_’  in  an identifier is changed to ’?’, and
          each ’.’ is changed to ’@’.

     If no flags are given, the default is ‐c.

     <files> specifies one or more files, which must be in A‐Nat‐
     ural  relocatable  format.   If more than one file is speci‐
     fied, then the output for each is preceded by a line of  the
     form

        file:

     Assembler  output  is  headed by a title directive (name for
     ISIS‐II), where the name is derived  from  the  filename  by
     stripping  off  any characters to the right of and including
     the leftmost ’.’, then appending a ’@’ in the case of  ISIS‐
     II, and a ’$’ in the case of Microsoft.

[1mRETURNS[0m
     dis80  returns  success if no diagnostics are produced, i.e.
     if all reads are successful and all file formats are  valid.
     Otherwise it returns failure.

     To convert chdr.o for use with Microsoft assembler code:

        % dis80 chdr.o >chdr.mac

[1mBUGS[0m
     The  symbols  "_c_"  and "_d_" must not be used in A‐Natural
     programs to be translated with dis80.
