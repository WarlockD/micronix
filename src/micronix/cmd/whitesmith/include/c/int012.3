[1mFUNCTION[0m
     int012.h  contains  those C operators which are encoded from
     the input to pp and which are used throughout all passes.

     [1mBINOP ‚Äê[0m
          binary operators are encoded such that ((BINOP & op) ==
          BINOP).

     [1mUNOP ‚Äê[0m
          unary  operators  are encoded such that ((UNOP & op) ==
          UNOP).

     Operators may be both unary and binary (e.g.  LTIMES).   The
     input tokens associated with operator defines are:

     [1mNAMING ‚Äê[0m
          Throughout the compiler, manifest constants whose names
          begin with ‚ÄôL‚Äô are  lexemes  that  originate  in  input
          text,  while  ‚ÄôD‚Äô  names indicate entities that are de‚Äê
          fined along the way.  Thus, DEXTERN  is  introduced  to
          describe the storage class of a symbol that has the ex‚Äê
          tern storage class, but is now further known from  con‚Äê
          text to be defined, i.e. initialized.
