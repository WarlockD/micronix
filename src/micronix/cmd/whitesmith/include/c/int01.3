     [1mint01.h [22m‚Äê interface between C preprocessor and


[1mFUNCTION[0m
     The C processor passes a stream of lexemes to the C compiler
     p1.  int01.h defines the language of these lexemes.

     [1mKEYWORDS ‚Äê[0m
          lexemes may be one of  the  C  keywords:  AUTO,  BREAK,
          CASE,  etc.  keywords are distinguished from other lex‚Äê
          emes by having the 0040 bit set.  Additions to the KEY‚Äê
          WORD  table  should  take  care  that  this bit is set.
          LSIZEOF is branded a pseudo keyword because its  encod‚Äê
          ing  must also be compatible with that of operators de‚Äê
          fined in int012.h.  Similarly, the created  lexemes  of
          p1  are  listed  here  to minimize future errors due to
          oversight: DARG is an argument, DEXTERN  is  a  defined
          extern,  DSTATIC  is a defined static, and FSTATIC is a
          file local static.

     [1mCONSTANTS ‚Äê[0m
          Lexemes other than keywords or punctuation  are  called
          constants,  and consist of more than one character.  p1
          can test for the next lexeme being a ‚Äôconstant‚Äô by:

                     if ((MASK & lexeme) == CONS)

     additions to the CONS table must ensure that the above rela‚Äê
     tionship holds.  Constants are:

                LDNUM   + 8 byte double constant
                LIDENT  + 1 byte ‚Äôn‚Äô + ‚Äôn‚Äô bytes id name
                LIFILE  + 1 byte ‚Äôn‚Äô + ‚Äôn‚Äô bytes file name
                LLINENO + 2 byte linenumber in current file
                LLNUM   + 4 byte long constant (long)
                LSNUM   + 4 byte long constant (short)
                LSTRING + 2 byte ‚Äôn‚Äô + ‚Äôn‚Äô bytes string
                LCNUM   + 4 byte long constant (char)
                LULNUM  + 4 byte long constant (unsigned long)
                LUSNUM  + 4 byte long constant (unsigned short)
                LUCNUM  + 4 byte long constant (unsigned char)

     All  numbers are encoded as for the host machine; hence both
     pp and p1 must be run on the same machine.

     A null byte, or end of file, signals end of stream.

     [1mPUNCTUATION ‚Äê[0m
          Lexemes may be C punctuation characters: LCOLON,  LCOM‚Äê
          MA, LDOT, etc.
