     p0lex.c  converts  token  lists  used throughout pp into the
     lexemes sent to p1, assuming ‚Äêx has been  set.   putls  fans
     out to one of lexident, lexstring, lexchars, lexnum, or lex‚Äê
     punct; and lexnum calls lexint or lexfloat.

     firnon, which finds the first non base digit, will be called
     with a base of 10 or 16.

     flaccum,  which  builds a floating number, is one of the few
     places in the compiler  to  use  floating  point.   It  uses
     _dtens[], which is a library array representing the floating
     powers of ten.

     lexchars builds an unsigned character, short, or  long  con‚Äê
     stant  into sbuf.  sbuf[0] and sbuf[n+1] are quotes; sbuf[1]
     through sbuf[n‚Äê3] contain the character constant.

     lexfloat has been a source of problems, since  TLIST  syntax
     bear  little  resemblance  to C language floating constants.
     lexfnxt is one such patch.

     lexident tries to match the identifier with a C  keyword  by
     scanning keytab (NKEYS has the number of keywords); if it is
     a keyword, the associated keyword token is passed on, other‚Äê
     wise  it  is  an  arbitary identifier, and the identifier is
     passed on.

     lexint puts out a long, short or  character  number.   Among
     other  tests,  to determine whether long or short or charac‚Äê
     ter, lexint assigns the number to a long,  a  short,  and  a
     character.   If it assigns to a character unchanged, it is a
     character constant; to a short unchanged, it is short;  oth‚Äê
     erwise long.  A trailing ‚ÄôL‚Äô or ‚Äôl‚Äô forces long.

     putcode  is  a  simple formatted output routine that accepts
     only the codes

     putls not only controls flow thoroughout p0lex, but it  also
     puts unadorned text if the ‚Äêx flag is not used.  To allow pp
     to also act as the first pass of the UNIX V6 compliler,  the
     ‚Äê6 flag instructs putls to put out one SOH for each #includ‚Äê
     ed newline when writing unadorned text to a file.
