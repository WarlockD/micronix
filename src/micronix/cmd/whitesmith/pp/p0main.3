     p0main.c  contains the main data flow through the preproces‐
     sor as outlined in the pp internals document.

     pflag is a secret flag set by nxtfile and the #include logic
     of  putns  to inform putls that the filename has changed and
     should be reported to p1.  If lexemes are not being put  out
     by putls, pflag is never cleared.

     A  static text buffer is used by getln to assemble a logical
     line.  Everyone is careful to make full use of a line before
     calling getln for the next line.

     The  code  in getln whichs builds the line without continua‐
     tions and comments is somewhat twisty; in pseudo‐code:

        get a buffer full
        while (still characters in the buffer)
                if (last char is ’´)
                        up line count
                        get as much as will fit in the buffer
                else if (’´ anywhere)
                        walk past ’´ plus next
                else if (’/*’)
                        if (’*/’ in same line)
                                get rid of comment
                        else if (getting a new buffer fails)
                                error ("incomplete comment")
                        else
                                place ’/*’ before new bufferful
                else if (newline)
                        up line count
                        return
                else
                        walk past one char

     free  and  frelst  calls  are  freely  sprinkled  throughout
     p0main.c and to some extent throughout p0subs.c.  Failure to
     free a generic structure will cause free storage to  quickly
     evaporate.
