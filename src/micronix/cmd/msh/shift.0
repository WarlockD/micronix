     PROGRAM
          shift ‐ adjust Shell arguments

     USAGE shift [ digit ]

     FUNCTION
          Shift is used in Shell command files to shift the argu‐
          ment list left by 1, so that old $2 can now be referred
          to by $1 and so forth.  Shift is useful to iterate over
          several arguments to a command file.

          For example, the command file

          while "$1"
                  pr ‐3 $1
                  shift
          end

          prints each of its arguments in 3‐column format.

          Shift is executed within the Shell.

          The optional argument causes shift to leave shell argu‐
          ments numbered lower than $digit alone on shifts; shift
          alone and "shift 1" are identical in effect.
