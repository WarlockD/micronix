USAGE
.br
.bd 
onintr
[ label ]

FUNCTION
.br
The
.bd 
onintr
command catches interrupts received while the Shell
is reading from a file.
.sp
After the interrupt, and after any active process has completed,
the Shell procedure is transferred to the label specified.
Unless another
.bd 
onintr
command is processed, the next interrupt
will kill the Shell.
.sp
The command without a label turns interrupts back on.
.sp
The special case ``onintr -'' causes interrupts to be totally
ignored,
both by the Shell itself and by
subsequent commands invoked by the Shell.
.sp
.bd 
Onintr
is executed within the Shell.
