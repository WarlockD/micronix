     PROGRAM
          goto ‐  command transfer

     USAGE
          goto label

     FUNCTION
          Goto  is allowed only when the Shell is taking commands
          from a file.

          The file is searched from the beginning for a line  be‐
          ginning  with  ‘:’  followed by one or more spaces fol‐
          lowed by the label.

          If such a line is found, the goto command returns.

          Since the read pointer in the command  file  points  to
          the  line  after  the label, the effect is to cause the
          Shell to transfer to the labelled line.

          ‘:’ is a do‐nothing command  that  is  ignored  by  the
          Shell and only serves to place a label.
