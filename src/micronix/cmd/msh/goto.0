       _G_o_t_o  is  allowed  only  when the Shell is taking commands from a file.
       The file is searched from the beginning for a line beginning  with  `:'
       followed  by  one or more spaces followed by the _l_a_b_e_l_.  If such a line
       is found, the _g_o_t_o command returns.  Since the read pointer in the com‚Äê
       mand  file  points  to the line after the label, the effect is to cause
       the Shell to transfer to the labelled line.

       `:' is a do-nothing command that is  ignored  by  the  Shell  and  only
       serves to place a label.
