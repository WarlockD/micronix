     PROGRAM
          switch ‐ shell multi‐way branch command

     USAGE
          switch arg
          : label1
               commands...
               breaksw
          : labeln
               commands...
               breaksw
          : default
               commands...
          endsw

     DESCRIPTION
          Switch searches forward in the input file for the first
          one of:

          1.   a label that pattern‐matches arg.
               The pattern‐matching used is that of the Shell  in
               generating argument lists.
          2.   the label default.
          3.   a matching endsw command.

          The  Shell  resumes reading commands from the next line
          after the location where  the  search  stopped.   Thus,
          switch  supplies  a ‘case’ or ‘computed goto’ statement
          similar to that of C.

          Because ‘:’ is ignored by the Shell, several labels may
          occur  in  order, so that the same sequence of commands
          is executed for several different values of arg.

          The breaksw command searches forward to  the  next  un‐
          matched  endsw,  and is normally used at the end of the
          sequence of commands following each label.  It  may  be
          omitted  to  allow common code to be shared among label
          values.

          Several breaksw commands may be  written  on  the  same
          line  to  exit  from that many levels of nested switch‐
          endsw pairs.

          The optional label default should be placed last, since
          switch always stops upon discovering it.  The construct
          can be nested: any labels enclosed  by  a  switch‐endsw
          pair are ignored by an outer switch.

          The  most common use of switch is to process ‘flag’ ar‐
          guments in a shell procedure.

     DIAGNOSTICS
          switch: missing endsw
          breaksw: missing endsw

     BUGS
          None of these commands should be  hidden  behind  semi‐
          colons.  Nested groups hidden behind if or else may al‐
          so cause trouble.
