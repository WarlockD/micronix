       _S_w_i_t_c_h searches forward in the input file for the first one of:

       1.   a  label  that  pattern-matches _a_r_g_.  The pattern-matching used is
       that of the Shell in generating argument  lists.   2.   the  label  _d_e_‐
       _f_a_u_l_t_.  3.   a matching _e_n_d_s_w command.

       The  Shell  resumes reading commands from the next line after the loca‐
       tion where the search stopped.  Thus, _s_w_i_t_c_h supplies a `case' or `com‐
       puted  goto' statement similar to that of C.  Because `:' is ignored by
       the Shell, several labels may occur in order, so that the same sequence
       of commands is executed for several different values of _a_r_g_.

       The  _b_r_e_a_k_s_w  command searches forward to the next unmatched _e_n_d_s_w_, and
       is normally used at the end of the sequence of commands following  each
       label.  It may be omitted to allow common code to be shared among label
       values.  Several _b_r_e_a_k_s_w commands may be written on the  same  line  to
       exit from that many levels of nested _s_w_i_t_c_h_e_n_d_s_w pairs.

       The  optional  label _d_e_f_a_u_l_t should be placed last, since _s_w_i_t_c_h always
       stops upon discovering it.  The construct can be nested: any labels en‐
       closed by a _s_w_i_t_c_h_-_e_n_d_s_w pair are ignored by an outer _s_w_i_t_c_h_.  The most
       common use of _s_w_i_t_c_h is to process `flag' arguments in a  shell  proce‐
       dure.

       None  of  these  commands  should  be hidden behind semicolons.  Nested
       groups hidden behind _i_f or _e_l_s_e may also cause trouble.
