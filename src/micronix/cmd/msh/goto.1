FUNCTION
.br
.bd
Goto
is allowed only when the Shell
is taking commands from a file.
.sp
The file is searched from the beginning
for a line beginning with `:' followed by one
or more spaces followed by the
.bd 
label.
.sp
If such a line is found, the
.bd 
goto
command returns.
.sp
Since the read pointer in the command file points to the
line after the label,
the effect is to cause the Shell to transfer to the
labelled line.
.sp
`:' is a do-nothing
command that is ignored by the Shell and only serves to place a label.
