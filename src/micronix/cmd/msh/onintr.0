     PROGRAM
          onintr ‐ handle interrupts in shell files

     USAGE
          onintr [ label ]

     FUNCTION
          The  onintr  command  catches interrupts received while
          the Shell is reading from a file.

          After the interrupt, and after any active  process  has
          completed,  the  Shell  procedure is transferred to the
          label specified.  Unless another onintr command is pro‐
          cessed, the next interrupt will kill the Shell.

          The command without a label turns interrupts back on.

          The  special  case ‘‘onintr ‐’’ causes interrupts to be
          totally ignored, both by the Shell itself and by subse‐
          quent commands invoked by the Shell.

          Onintr is executed within the Shell.
