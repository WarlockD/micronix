this is the whitesmith's c preprocessor ported to stdio
for the whitesmith compiler, and eventually to a completely
portable, albiet pre-ansi form.

the preprocessor used a rather idiosyncratic C library that
only remotely resembled what has come to be the standard C
library, which appeared with v7.

worse yet, some of the names are the same, but functionality
is different.  

one of the more interesting interfaces is alloc/free with 2 arguments.  
free returns the second argument.
it facilitates a clean linked list reclaim.
	chain = free(chain, chain->next)

similarly, to allocate memory and placing a pointer in the first word,
as one might want to do when building a linked list,
	head = alloc(bytes, head)

wierdly, something like generic linked list machinery is assumed
by functions like frelst(head, tail), which frees a linked list
from head to tail, returning tail.
