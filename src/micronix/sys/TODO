------------------

there is some profoundly troubling code in here that clearly was
put there to optimize the code that whitesmith's was emitting:

declaring scalar types static when the compiler runs out of registers
will result in faster, smaller and very very broken code if the function
being called could have more than one process running in it due to sleeping
on a disk i/o.

these 2 processes will step on each other horribly.

ANY static declarations in any functions are very suspect, and either
need a lock, with all the deadlock possiblities that implies, or we
need to just KNOW that it, and any functions it calls, cannot ever sleep.


tracking this down is simply a matter of searching for the string 'static'.
