o Took out diablo support (saved a K)

o took out fillque () down scheduling

o converted segalloc and segfree to 
  pick up wher you left off search
  instead of brute force algorithm

o converted ifill to pick up where
  it left off search algorithm.
  Fixed unreadable ilist block bug.
  Fill super block with 100 inodes
  istead of 16.

o No more special meaning for ESC
  as an input character.

o Only XON restarts output.

o Removed code which echoed the kill character

o Long term pid's in the range 1-30000

o Removed the parallel printer gooser
  (not needed for centronics support)

o Simplified buffer linkage mechanism in dj
  driver

o Add support for all 4 kinds of IBM PC floppies
  + auto recognition of dual-sided dos diskettes.

o Limited modem control, hangup signal send on carrier loss.

o Limited record locking. Lock against lock only.
  Immediate error return, no error checking.
  Two system calls added, numbers 49 and 50.
  Syntax:    lock (fd, count);
  The open file reffered to by fd has the region locked
  which starts at the current read/write pointer
  (set by seek) and extends for count bytes.
  The largest singly lockable region is 64K - 1 bytes.
  Possible error returns are EBUSY if the region is currently locked.
  ENFILE is the lock table is full.
  unlock (fd);
  The open file referred to by fd has the region unlocked
  in which the currently referenced byte happens to fall.
  Unlock always succeeds.  It doesn't complain about
  finding no regions to unlock.
  Closing a file automatically releases any locks on it.
  There are no sleeps in either system call.

o Core dump eliminated. (commented out)

o Drop data terminal ready on cold mstop.
  Hang up modem.

o Don't zero out blocks in bget()
  Added block zeroing to imap() imap.c line 48
  Blocks were redundantly zeroed.

o Exec /etc/init only on boot.

o Add argument value for proc 0 and proc 1
  "swap" and "init".  Garbage appears under ps otherwise.

o Eliminated cpu member from proc structure.
  Eliminated cpu accounting as such.

o Eliminated "hier"

o Eliminated the idle flag, since its purpose was to prevent
  idle time from being charged to the current process
  and time is no longer charged for.

o In trap, check for interrupt bit low in trap reg.
  if so don't check for other three types of traps.

o In sig(), try early case elimiation, in the expectation that most of the time
  sig will do nothing.

o Changing to 8 HERTZ basic clock
  Rechedule every eigth of a second.
  This is an attempt at smoothness of cpu distribution.

o Eliminated "Memory allocation fault" panic
