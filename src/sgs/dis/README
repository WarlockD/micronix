README - readme file for Z80/Z280 disassembler
----------------------------------------------

This package contains an intelligent Z80/Z280 (compile-time selectable)
disassembler for CP/M .COM files.  It is derived from an excellent dumb
disassembler by Luc Rooijakkers <lwj@cs.kun.nl>.

The disassembler has the following features:
	produces output capable of being assembled.
 	detects code sequences by tracing jump targets
	specific addresses may be forced to be either code or data
	a starting address may be specified
	an ending address may be specified
	disassembly may be started at any byte offset into the file
	it is very,very fast.
	a Usage message is issued if no arguments are specified.

Configuration notes:

	several constants are found in the disas.c source file.
	defining any of these in the makefile will result in the
	makefile values overriding the defaults.

	TARGETS:	maximum number of branch targets and data labels
	BUFLEN:		maximum size of disassembly in binary
	
	if qsort is not present in your libc (yuck!), edit the source
	file to #undef BINARY_SEARCH. this will slow down the disassembly
	somewhat.

share and enjoy
