Welcome to Micronix. The stand-alone floppy system that
you are now running is designed to initialize your hard
disk, and to perform surgery on it if necessary. Please
do not attempt to run multiple users yet. To initialize
your hard disk:

        IF YOU HAVE                        TYPE
an m5  with the HDDMA controller        source m5init
an m10 with the HDDMA controller        source m10init
an m16 with the HDDMA controller        source m16init
any drive with the HDCA controller      source hdinit

Then boot Micronix from the hard disk. If you have any
questions, please read the Installation section of the
Micronix User's Manual.
