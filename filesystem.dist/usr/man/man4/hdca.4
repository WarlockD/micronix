FUNCTION
.in +5
.br
The HDCA controls up to four 8 inch Winchester disk drives.
Micronix currently supports 3 drive sizes:

.in +5
.nf
m10	10 megabytes
m20	20 megabytes
m26	26 megabytes
.in -5
.fi

The device names (in the /dev directory) for these disks
depend on their position on the HDCA daisy-chain.
Drive A is called "hda", drive B is called "hdb", etc.
The major/minor device numbers are:

.ti +5
.nf
1/0  hda      1/1  hdb      1/2  hdc      1/3  hdd
.fi

Unlike the HDDMA drives, Micronix can automatically detect
the size of the HDCA drives, so there is no need to indicate
the drive size in the device name or number.

Micronix does not support a disk formatting program, so
each drive must be formatted under CP/M.
A sector skew of 6 is recommended, but is not critical.
Since these drives are soft-sectored, there is no
compatibility problem with different skews.
