DESCRIPTION
.in +5
.br
The null device has the curious property that
everything written to it is completely ignored and thrown away.
Reading from this device yields
an end of file every time.

The minor device number is ignored.
The major device number is zero in the current
implementation.

This device may seem to be of limited usefulness,
but don't get rid of it, the shell uses it
to set up the standard input of background processes.
