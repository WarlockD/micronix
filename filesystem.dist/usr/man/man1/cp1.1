FUNCTION
.in +5
.br
.bd
Cp1 
is the parsing pass of the C compiler.
It accepts a sequential file of
lexemes from the preprocessor, 
.bd
cpp, 
and writes a sequential file
of flow graphs and parse trees, suitable for input to a machine-dependent
code generator, 
.bd
cp2.
The operation of 
.bd
cp1 
is largely independent of any target machine.
The flag options are:
.sp
.in +10
.ta 10
.ti -10
-a	Compile code for machines with separate address and data registers.
.sp
.ti -10
-b#	Enforce storage boundaries according to 
.bd
#, 
which is reduced modulo 4.  

A bound of 0 leaves no holes in structures or 
auto allocations. 

A bound of 1 (default) requires short, intermediate and 
longer data to begin on an even bound.  

A bound of 2 is the same
as 1 except that 4 to 8 bytes of data are forced to a multiple of a
four-byte boundary.

A bound of 3 is the same as 2, except that eight bytes of data (doubles)
are forced to a multiple of an eight-byte boundary.

.ti -10
-c	Ignore case distinctions in testing external identifiers for equality,
and map all names to lowercase on output.
By default, case distinctions matter.

.ti -10
-e	Do not force loading of extern references that are 
declared, but never defined or used in an expression.  Default is 
used to load all external references declared.

.ti -10
-l	Take integers and pointers to be 4-bytes long.  Default is 2-bytes.

.ti -10
-m	Treat each structure/union as a separate name space, and require 
.bd
x.m
to mean 
.bd
x 
is a structure and 
.bd
m 
one of its members.
.bp
.ti -10
-n#	Ignore characters after the first 
.bd
# 
in testing external identifiers
for equality.  Default is 7; maximum is 8.

.ti -10
-o file	Write the output to the specified file and write 
error messages to 
STDOUT.  Default is STDOUT for output and STDERR for error messages.

.ti -10
-r#	Assign no more than 
.bd
# 
variables to registers at any one time,
where 
.bd
# 
is reduced modulo 4.  Default is three register variables.

.ti -10
-u	Take "string" as an array of unsigned characters, not an array of 
characters.

.in -10
If <file> is present, it is used as the input file instead of the default,
STDIN.
On many systems, the 
.bd
-o 
option and <file> are mandatory
because STDIN and STDOUT
are interpreted as text files, and hence become corrupted.

Cp1 
is usually sandwiched between 
.bd
cpp 
and 
.bd
cp2, 
as in:
.sp
.nf
.bd 3
		cpp -x -o temp1 file.c
		cp1 -o temp2 temp1
		cp2 -o file.mac temp2
