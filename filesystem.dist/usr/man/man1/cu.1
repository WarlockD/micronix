SYNOPSIS
.in +5
.br
cu device [-s speed]
.sp 2
.in -5
.bd
DESCRIPTION
.in +5
.br
.bd
Cu 
may be used to connect to other machines through your
Micronix machine.

When the 
.bd
cu 
command is given, 
one process is set up to handle sending characters to the remote
system,
one is set up to receive them.
Much of this is not obvious to the user.

When 
.bd
cu 
is ready it prints a "~".
Thereafter, whatever you type will be immediately sent
to the remote port, and whatever is received from it is
sent to your terminal.
So, typically, you press a single key on your terminal,
Micronix takes it and re-transmits it to the remote machine,
which will usually send it back, at which point
Micronix receives it and sends it to your terminal
and you see the character on your screen!

There is definitely an upper limit to the baud rate
you can use for the remote port -
1200 baud is the highest recommended.
If the remote machine is another Micronix machine,
additional commands apply.
You many copy a file from local to remote machine via:
.sp
.nf
.bd
	~%put file
.sp
.fi
Or from remote to local via:
.sp
.nf
.bd
	~%take file
.sp
.fi
Note only text files may be copied reliably.
This need not be a drawback, however, because
any file can be converted into a text file, transferred,
and then converted back again.

Both the sending and receiving processes recognize
.sp
.nf
.bd
	~>file

	~>
.sp
.fi
as starting and ending delimiters for file diversion,
so that in order to copy a file from a foreign system
to the local one, all you have to do is get the foreign system
to generate:
.sp
.nf
.bd
	~>filename
	Text of file ...
	more file ...
	~>
.sp
.fi
That is, a beginning marker, the text of the file, and then an ending
marker.

To get out of 
.bd
cu 
type:
.sp
.nf
.bd
	~.
.fi

EXAMPLE
.in +5
.br
To set up communication over a modem, get your hardware set up
and then type:
.sp
.ti +8
.bd
cu /dev/ttyC -s 300

In this example the modem would be plugged into Micronix
port C (the third one).

Typically, one must reverse the transmit and receive lines
in the cable running from the computer to the modem.
One reverses the wires running to pins 2 and 3 of the connector
at one end or the other.
