FUNCTION       
.br
.in +5
Each of the named files is removed, if possible.
It is also used also to remove directories; files must be removed first,
however.

The -r option removes entire
hierarchies of files.
This means all files, subdirectories, directories, etc. will be
permanently erased,
which means that
this option is quite 
.ul
dangerous!
When run interactively, this program asks if it may proceed with the requests,
however, offering some amount of protection, but still, take care when
using this command.
