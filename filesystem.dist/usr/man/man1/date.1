FUNCTION
.in +5
.br
Only the super-user may set the time.
If no argument is given, the current date and time are printed.  
Otherwise, all of the arguments are taken together with the present
date and time to produce a new date and time.  The systems'
idea of the time is set.

.bd
[year], [date], [hour], [minute], 
and 
.bd
[second] 
are each given
as decimal numbers.

.bd
[month] 
is the name of a month, in English; case is ignored. The first 
three letters of the name of the month must be given.

If any specification is omitted, the current value of that specification
is used in its stead.  
A common error is to attempt to set the day of the week.
This is not permissable in the command line.
