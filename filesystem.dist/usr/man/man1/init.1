FUNCTION      
.in +5
.br
.bd
Init
creates an automatic process
for each terminal on a which a user may log in.

.bd
Init
first brings the system up in single-user mode, 
with only the console active.
If there is a password on the "root" account,
it demands this first. (Therefore, it is a good idea
to keep a Micronix diskette with an unprotected root
account, in case the root password is lost.)

When the single user shell exits, 
.bd
init
runs the shell script "/etc/rc" if it exists,
then reads the file "/etc/ttys", and branches several times
to create a process for each terminal specified in the file.

When one of init's child processes terminates,
a new process is generated to take its place.  Normally, this 
takes place automatically.

The format of the "/etc/tty" file is as follows,
(one per line):
.nf
.bd
		tty A (9600) (on) (shake)
.fi
.sp 2
.in -5
.bd
