FUNCTION    
.in +5
.br
.bd
Fsck 
is a complete Micronix file system maintenance package.
System crashes
may cause the
Micronix file systems
(as well as standard UNIX version 6 file systems)
to become internally inconsistent
in potentially dangerous ways to your data.
It is also possible for the physical device on which
a file system resides to develop unreadable spots.
The 
.bd
fsck 
program ratifies these inconsistencies and maintains the file system.

.bd
NOTE! 
Do not run
.bd
fsck
on an 
.ul
active 
file system.

If information in the file system is changing
while 
.bd
fsck 
is taking its "snapshot" of the state of the file system,
it will get the wrong idea and will try and fix
things that were not wrong in the first place.
By typing
.sp	
.ti +5
.bd
fsck filesystem
.sp
where 
.bd
filesystem 
is the name of the device on which the file system
in question lives, you can bring your file system completely up to par.
If no specification is made, 
.bd
fsck 
searches for and attempts
to fix all file system problems.
.sp 2
Options:
.sp
.in +5
.ta 5
.ti -5
-t	Test all of the blocks on the file system to
see that each is readable.  Systems on large disks may take some 
time to complete.
.sp
.ti -5
-n	No changes will be made.  
.bd
Fsck 
will only look and tell you what it would do.
.sp 2
.in -5
.ti -7
.bd
Fsck 
can fix:
.sp
.in +5
.ti -5
-	Two files claiming the same block.  The block is copied 
and a copy is given to each file.
.bp
.ti -5
-	File containing a bad block.  An attempt is made to copy 
the bad block; in any case, a new block is allocated to fill the 
spot.  The bad block is assigned to a file in the directory 
"badblocks".
.sp
.ti -5
-	Duplicates in the free list.
.sp
.ti -5
-	Allocated blocks in the free list.
.sp
.ti -5
-	Blocks missing from the free list.
.sp
.ti -5
-	Bad block in the free chain.  The free list is rebuilt from scratch.
.sp
.ti -5
-	File for which there is no directory entry (an orphan). 
An entry is made in the "lost+found" directory.
.sp
.ti -5
-	Missing directory self link ".".
.sp
.ti -5
-	Missing directory parental link "..".
.sp
.ti -5
-	Disconnected directory. Appropriate links are made to 
directory names in "lost+found," if necessary.
.sp
.ti -5
-	Imbalanced directory entry - link counts. Resolved in 
favor of the directory entries, i.e., the link count is changed.
.sp 2

.bd
Fsck 
cannot fix:
.sp
