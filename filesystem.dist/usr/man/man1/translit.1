FUNCTION
.br
.in +5
.fi
.br
Translit
can be used to perform a variety of useful character
mapping functions.
.bd
Translit
modifies its input on a character-by-character basis.
.bd
Translit
changes each character in its 
.bd
from 
set to the corresponding
one in its 
.bd
to 
set.  If there is no 
.bd
to 
set, the effect is to remove each character  found in
the 
.bd
from 
set.
If the 
.bd
to 
set has fewer characters than the 
.bd
from 
set,
the last character in the 
.bd
to 
set is repeated as many times as needed
to  fill out the 
.bd
to 
set.
.sp
Notation of the form
x-y may be used as shorthand set notation to mean all the characters
lexically between x and y,  where x and y are letters of the
same case or both digits.
.sp
If 
.bd
^ 
is the first character of the
.bd
from 
specification, it is understood
to mean all characters 
.ul
not
in the following specification.
.sp
Notation of the form 
.bd
@377 
(an "at" sign followed by up to 
three digits of octal) may be used to specify characters by ASCII value.
.sp
If the 
.bd
from 
set contains fewer characters than the 
.bd
to
set,
or if the 
.bd
^ 
is used as above,
the last character of the 
.bd
to 
set
is sufficiently replicated to fill the 
.bd
from
set to the size of the 
.bd
to 
set.
Furthermore, contiguous characters which
are elements of the 
.bd
to 
set for which there is no explicit
corresponding character in the 
.bd
to 
set are collapsed to a single occurrence of the 
last character in the specification for the 
.bd
to 
set.

EXAMPLES
.br
.in +5
.nf
To replace all occurrences of x by y:
.sp
.in +8
.bd
translit x y <input >output
.in -8
.sp
To change x to y and y to x:
.sp
.in +8
.bd
translit xy yx <input >output
.in -8
.bp
To delete all occurrences of A:
.sp
.in +8
.bd
translit A <input >output
.in -8
.sp
To map all lower case into upper case:
.sp
.in +8
.bd
translit a-z A-Z <input >output
.in  -8
.sp
To put one white space separated symbol per line:

.ti +8
.bd
translit @40@11@12 @12 <in >out

program.
