FUNCTION
.in +5
.br
.bd
Archive
maintains a group of files combined into a single archive file.
The archiver has good protection against
data loss through disk overflow and
works equally well with text and non-text files
(for those systems on which there is a distinction).
.sp
Exactly one key character must be specified to
indicate which action you wish 
.bd
archive 
to perform.

The meanings of the key characters are:
.sp 2
.in +10
.ta 10
.ti -10
d	Delete the named files from the archive file.
If no names are given, the archive is not altered.
.sp
.ti -10
p	Print the named files in the archive.
Non-printing characters are filtered out.
.sp
.ti -10
t	Print a table of contents of the archive file.
If no names are given, all files in the archive are tabled.
If names are given, only those files are tabled.
.sp
.ti -10
u	Update the named files in the archive.
If the named archive does not exist, it is created.
If no names are given, all files in the archive are updated.
If a name is given which is not in the archive,  
a new archive entry is created and its contents becomes the 
contents of the named file.
Otherwise, the contents of archive's entry is replaced
with the current version of the file.
.sp
.ti -10
x	Extract the named files.
The files in the archive are copied out to ordinary files of the same name.
The former contents of the ordinary files are destroyed.
If no names are given, all files in the archive are extracted.
In neither case does x alter the archive.
