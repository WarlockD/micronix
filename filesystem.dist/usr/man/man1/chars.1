FUNCTION
.in +5
.br
The number of characters in each of the named files is
printed on the standard output.
If it would provide
additional information, a total
is then printed.
If no file names are specified, or if "-" is given as a file name,
the standard input
is read up to an end-of-file and the number of characters
read is printed.
.sp
Note: On some systems, (but not Micronix), the number of characters in a file
is poorly defined.
There are sometimes two kinds of files - text and binary.
The standard input is assumed to be a text file while
files specified by name are assumed to be binary files.
