FUNCTION
.in +5 
.br
.bd
Du 
find the amount of storage space used by the files
whose names are given.
If a directory name is given, then the disk usage
is reported for all the files in the directory
and the same is done for each directory on down the tree.

If and when disk space becomes an issue, this
program can be very useful at showing you
where all your disk space is going.

If there are several links to a file, the space used
by the file is counted only once.

Space used by directories themselves is not counted,
nor are indirect blocks, as these are
considered system overhead and in any event do not
amount to more than a few percent.

The program doesn't know about files with holes in them:
they are counted as if all the holes were filled.
.sp 
Options:

.ta 5
.in +5
.ti -5
-a	All.  Normally a total block count is produced
only for each directory.
With the -a option in effect, a block count is produced for each file,
regardless.

.ti -5
-s	Summary.  Only a grand total is printed.

To find out which directory has that enormous file in it:
.sp
.ti +5
.bd
du

To get the name of the offending file itself:
.sp
.ti +5
.bd

To get an overview of the top of the file system:
.sp
.ti +5
