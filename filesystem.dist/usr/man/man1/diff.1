FUNCTION    
.in +5
.br
.bd
Diff
is a file comparator intended for use with text files.  It 
attempts to find a minimal set of differences between
lines of the given files.

Differences are reported by lines of the form

.in +8
.bd
N a R,S

.bd
N,M d R

.bd
N,M c R,S

.in -8
Where N and M are line numbers in file1; R and S are line numbers
in file2.

Following each line of this type
is a list of the affected lines in file1 marked by "<"
and a list of the affected lines in file2 marked by ">".

If the 
.bd
-e 
flag is given, the output takes the format of a command
script for 
.bd
edit 
to change the first file into the second.
