FUNCTION
.in +5
.br
.bd
Ptc
is a program that accepts as input lines of Pascal text and produces
as output a corresponding C program which is acceptable to the
Whitesmiths, Ltd. C compiler.  If <file> is present, it is taken as
the Pascal program to translate; otherwise input is taken from STDIN.     

The flags are:
.sp 
.in +5
.ta 5
.ti -5
-c	Pass comments through to the C program.

.ti -5
-f	Set the precision for reals to single precision (float).
Default is double.

.ti -5
-k	Permit pointer types to be defined using type identifiers from
outer blocks.  Default is ISO standard, i.e., the type pointed to must
be defined in the same type declaration as the pointer type definition.

.ti -5
-m#	Make # the number of bits in MAXINT excluding the sign bit,
e.g., MAXINT becomes 32767 for -m15, 1 for -m, etc.  Default for
MAXINT is 32766 [sic].  Acceptable values for # are in the range
[0, 32).

.ti -5
-o*	Write the C program to the file * and diagnostics to STDOUT.
Default is STDOUT for the C program and STDERR for diagnostics.

.ti -5
-r	Turn off runtime array bounds checks.

.ti -5
-s#	Make # the number of bits in the maximum allowable set size,
i.e., the size of all sets whose base type is integer becomes the
specified power of two.  Acceptable values are in the range [0, 32).
Default is 8 (256 elements).

.in -5
The CP/M operating system implementation on the Intel 8080 and Zilog
Z80 restricts the acceptable value for # to the range [0, 16]; for
maximum portability, this restriction should be honored.

Identifiers are mapped to uppercase to keep from conflicting with those
declared as reserved words in C.  Moreover, structure declarations may
be produced that contain conflicting field declarations; and
declarations are present for library functions that may not be needed.
All of these pecadillos are forgiven by the use of appropriate C
compiler options.
