DESCRIPTION

.br
Micronix has an inter-user mail system.
The
.bd
mail
program sends letters to the appropriate system user.
Letters are sent to another user by entering:
.sp
.in +5
% mail user name

To enter the letter, just begin typing.
Enter as many lines as necessary.
Letters are terminated by entering a single period, or a ^D at the
beginning of the last line.

The next time the user logs in, he will be greeted
with the message "You have mail".

To read his mail, he simply enters
.sp
.in +5
.bd
% mail
.sp
.in -5
The letter is printed on-screen.  The user is then asked
if he wants to keep his mail.

The appropriate reply is "yes" to keep it, or "no" to delete it.  Kept
mail is stored in the "mbox" file in the user's directory.
