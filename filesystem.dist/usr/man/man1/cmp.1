FUNCTION    
.in +5
.br
.bd
Cmp
compares two given files.
Nothing is printed if they are identical.
If a difference is encountered, 
.bd
cmp 
announces the byte number and
line number at which the difference occurred.
.sp
If one file is an initial sub-sequence of the other, that fact is 
also noted.  If the 
.bd
-l 
option is used, the byte number (decimal) and the differing bytes
(octal) are printed for each difference.
