FUNCTION   
.in +5
.br
.bd
Sum 
computes and prints a check sum and block count for each named file.
(Blocks are 512 bytes long.)
If no file names are given, it computes a check sum for the standard input.
.sp
If the -r option is used,
.bd
sum
recursively descends the
file hierarchy, summing each file as it goes.
In recursive mode, special files and directories are not summed.

As an example, check sums can be used to verify the integrity of 
a file over the phone.
Sums are in the range 0 to 65,535.
If two files have identical check sums, it is quite likely
that they are identical.
