FUNCTION   
.in +5
.br
Each user name is associated with a group number.
Associated with each file is a user ID number (the owner of the file)
and a group ID number (the group of the file).  These numbers are used
in permission determinations.

The relationship between group numbers and names is established by the
group file.
The format of the group file is as follows:
.sp
.in +3
Each line of the file defines one group name.

The group name is followed by a colon, then followed by the 
encrypted group password, if one exists.
This is followed by a colon, which is followed by the group 
number (in decimal), followed
by a colon, followed by the group comment field which may contain anything
you desire, or nothing at all.
