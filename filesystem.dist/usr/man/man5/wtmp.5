FUNCTION       
.in +5
.br
This file records all logins and logouts.
Its format is like 
.bd
utmp
(5) with these exceptions:
A null user name indicates a logout on the associated typewriter.
Furthermore, the typewriter name 
.bd
~
indicates the system was rebooted at the indicated time;
the adjacent pair of entries with typewriter names
.bd
|
and 
.bd
}
indicate the system-maintained time just before and just
after a 
.bd
date 
command changed the systems' idea of the time.
.bd
Wtmp 
is maintained by 
.bd
login 
(1) and 
.bd
init 
(1).  Neither of these programs creates the file,
so if is is removed, record-keeping is turned off.
