FUNCTION   
.in +5
.br
.bd
Gtty
gets the status of the terminal
associated with the file descriptor,
and writes the status into the 6-byte
structure pointed at by vec.
(This structure is the same as that passed by 
.bd
stty.
) Actually, this call may be made to any character device,
but devices that do not like it may
return an error.

.bd
Ispeed and ospeed are one of:

.nf
.in +4
.bd 16
0     1200 baud
1       50 baud
2       75 baud
3      110 baud
4      134.5 baud
5      150 baud
6      200 baud
7      300 baud
8      600 baud
9     1200 baud
10    1800 baud
11    2400 baud
12    4800 baud
13    9600 baud
14   19200 baud
15    1200 baud

.fi

The next two characters specify the
erase and kill characters, respectively.
(The defaults are ^H and ^X).
.bp
The mode specifies what services are performed
by the system on input and output.
Currently, these are:
.nf

.in +4
.bd 5
0100000  Use the RS-232 clear-to-send line
 040000  Keep all 8 bits of input data
   0040  Raw input
   0020  Cr -> lf mapping
   0010  Echo input
   0002  Expand tabs
.in -4

.fi
In raw mode, all characters are passed immediately
to the program without waiting for a full line to be typed,
there is no erase or kill processing,
and there is no recognition
of any special control characters.
In cooked mode, the following control characters
are recognized:
.in +4

.nf
.bd 6
^D  end-of-file (when typed alone on a line)
^\  send a quit signal to this tty's processes
DEL send an interrupt signal to same
^B  send a background signal to same
ESC freeze the output from this tty
^S  same as ESC
.in -4

.fi
Note that even while the tty is in raw mode,
the other modes still have an effect.

In cr->lf mode, input crs are turned into lfs,
and output crs or lfs are turned into cr-lfs.

In echo mode, input is echoed immediately.
If the mode is also raw, it is echoed exactly
as typed; otherwise, the special control characters
are not echoed, the kill character is echoed as
itself plus a newline, and the erase character
is echoed as backspace-space-backspace.

In expand-tabs mode, tabs are output as the
number of spaces needed to bring the cursor
to the next 0-mod-8 column.

On success, the status is placed in the 6-byte structure
pointed at by vec.
