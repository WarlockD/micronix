FUNCTION       
.in +5
.fi
.bd
Fstat 
is identical to
.bd
stat,
except that it operates on open files
(via the file descriptor)
rather than on files given by name.
This is often used to examine
the status of the standard input and output,
whose names are usually unknown.
Buf is the address of a 36 byte buffer,
into which the following information is
placed:

.nf
.bd 15
struct stat
	{
char	minor,		/* minor device */
	major;		/* major device */
int	inumber,	/* inode number */
	flags;		/* see below */
char	nlinks,		/* number of links */
	uid,		/* user id of owner */
	gid,		/* group id of owner */
	size0;		/* high byte of size */
int	size1,		/* low word of size */
	sddr[8];	/* block numbers */
long	actime,		/* time of last access */
	modtime;	/* " last modification */
	};

The flags are as follows (values in octal):

.nf
.bd 15
 100000		inode is allocated
 060000		2-bit file type
	 000000		plain file
	 040000		directory
	 020000		character-special file
	 060000		block-special file
 010000		large file
 004000		set user-id on execution
 002000		set group-id on execution
 001000		one writer only
 000400		read (owner)
 000200		write (owner)
 000100		execute or search directory (owner)
 000070		read, write, execute (group)
 000007		read, write, execute (others)

.fi
The one-writer-only bit allows the file to be open for
writing in at most one process at a time.

.in -5
.bd
RETURNS
.in +5
.fi
A 0 indicates success, a -1 indicates failure
(bad file descriptor).

.in -5

RETURNS
.in +5
.br
The carry flag is cleared on success, or set on failure.
On success, the status is placed in the 36-byte area
pointed at by buf.
