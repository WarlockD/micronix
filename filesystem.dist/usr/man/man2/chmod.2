FUNCTION    
.in +5
.br
The mode of the file is set as indicated.
Only the owner of a file, or the super-user, may change the mode.
Modes are constructed by ORing together some combination
of the following (octal) values:

.in +8
.nf
.bd 8
4000  Set user id on execution
2000  Set group id on execution
1000  Currently ignored
0400  Read by owner
0200  Write by owner
0100  Execute (or search directory) by owner
0070  Read, write, execute (search) by group
0007  Read, write, execute (search) by others
.in -8

.fi
When a file with the set-user-id flag is executed,
the effective user ID of the process is set to the owner
of the file. 
(In this way, for instance, a spelling program could use
a secret dictionary.)

For security reasons, whenever a file is opened
for writing, its set-id flags are cleared.
