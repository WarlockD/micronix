FUNCTION            
.in +5
.br
.bd
Unlink 
removes the indicated entry from its directory.
If this was the last link to the file, the file is
removed and its space is freed. If the file was open
in any process, this removal is delayed until the file
is closed, even though its last directory entry
has disappeared.

In order to unlink a file, a user must have write
permission on its directory. Write permission is not
required on the file itself. Only the super-user
can unlink a directory.
