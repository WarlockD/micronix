FUNCTION   
.in +5
.br
If the file does not exist,
and if the parent directory is writable,
it is created with the given mode.
If the file does exist and is writable,
it is truncated to 0 length,
and its mode and owner remain unchanged.
In either case, the file is
opened for writing only, and a file descriptor is returned.

See 
.bd
chmod 
(2) for the construction of modes. Note that the
file is opened for writing, even if the given mode does not
allow writing.
This can be used as a locking mechanism, in that another
program will not be able to create the same file.

.bd
Creat
is subject to the limit of 16 open files per process.
