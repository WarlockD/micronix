FUNCTION       
.in +5
.br
A file descriptor is a word returned from a successful
.bd
open, creat, dup,
or
.bd
pipe
call.
Buffer is a memory location where at most
nbytes of data will be placed.
The number of bytes actually read is returned.
This may well be less than nbytes;
a read on a terminal, for example, will return at most one line.
If the value 0 is returned, then the file has been exhausted.


.in -5
.bd
RETURNS
.in +5
.br
A - 1 indicates an error.  A return of 0 indicates end-of-file.
Any other value indicates a successful read of that many bytes.
