FUNCTIONS
.in +5
.br
.bd
Putc
appends 
.bd
c
(character) to
.bd
stream,
the named output; it returns the character written.

.bd
Putchar(c)
is the same as
.bd
putc(c, stdout).

.bd
Fputc
acts the same as
.bd
putc
but is a function rather than a macro.  It can be used to save
object text.

.bd
Putw
appends 
.bd
w
(word) to output 
.bd
stream 
and returns the word written.  It does not assume or cause
special alignment in the file.

.bd
Stdout
(standard stream) is only buffered if the output refers to something
other than a terminal (default).
.bd
Setbuf
(3) changes the default.

.bd
Stderr
(also a standard stream) is unbuffered unconditionally (default).
.bd
Freopen
[see
.bd
fopen 
(3)] causes it to become buffered; again,
.bd
setbuf
changes the default.

Unbuffered output streams appear on the destination file or terminal
as soon as they are written.  Buffered output streams save up characters
and write them as a block.  Blocks may be forced out prematurely with
.bd
fflush
[see
.bd
fclose
(3)].

ERRORS
.in +5
.br
These functions return the end of file constant upon error. 

.bd
Ferror
(3) should be used to detect
.bd
putw
errors.

Errors may occur some time after the initial call to
.bd
putc.

NOTES
.in +5
.br
Since 
.bd
putc
is implemented as a macro, it treats a
.bd
stream
argument improperly.  Specifically,

.ce
.bd
putc(c, *f++);

does not work sensibly.
