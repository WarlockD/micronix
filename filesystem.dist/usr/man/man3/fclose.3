FUNCTION   
.in +5
.br
.bd
Fclose
causes any buffers for the named
.bd
stream
to be emptied and the file to be closed.  Buffers
allocated by the standard I/O system are freed.  This function is
performed automatically by calling
.bd
exit
(2).

.bd
Fflush 
causes any buffered data for the named output
.bd
stream
to be written to that file.  The stream file remains open.

ERRORS        
.in +5
.br
These routines return an
.bd
EOF
if
.bd
stream 
is not associated with an output file, or if
buffered data cannot be transferred to that file.
