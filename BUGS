micronix is pretty cool, but there are some things that don't quite work the way
you would expect:

usersim:
	sometimes the shell gets confused trying to run the contents of the
    current directory as a script.  this does not seem to happen when running
	as root

/bin/sh: 
	very primitive.  
	no variables.  no environment.  no conditionals or loops.
	does pipes and redirection and background processes

/bin/more:
	does not do the right thing with pipes.  it reads stdin for the prompt
	input, so something like man sh | more does not work.  it should open
	/dev/tty for the prompting dialog

/bin/ps:
	opens /dev/mem and grunges around. uh, no.
