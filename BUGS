micronix is pretty cool, but there are some things that don't quite work the way
you would expect:

/bin/sh: 
	very primitive.  
	no variables.  no environment.  no conditionals or loops.
	does pipes and redirection and background processes

/bin/make:
	no variables.  this makes every makefile a brute force kind of thing.

/bin/more:
	does not do the right thing with pipes.  it reads stdin for the prompt
	input, so something like man sh | more does not work.  it should open
	/dev/tty for the prompting dialog

/bin/ps:
	opens /dev/mem and grunges around. uh, no.

/bin/upm:
	the cp/m simulator is interesting and currently not working.
	for some reason, it was distributed with symbols, which may be useful
	to disassemble/decompile it.
