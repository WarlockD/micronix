this simulator is intended to be a simulation at the behavioral level of the target system,
with a few simplifications: all I/O happens right now, and we don't have any concurrency.

device drivers are again, behavioral, and we don't simulate things we don't use.

the debugger looks a lot like an in-circuit emulator, and it will grow to the point where it
can be used to debug the micronix kernel.

added the ability to import and export text to the simulated environment via port 2.
this interfaces via  files named file.inp and file.out.
pip can be patched to use inp: and out: to send and receive a file. this patch is trivial, and is
documented in hsim.c

the clock now works, at least the 1990 is simulated for reading.  setting, forget it.
