let's decompile z80 machine code into a tree of basic blocks
that contain a list of expressions.
then, walk the tree and output the source code.  easy peasy.

find the basic blocks, which are defined as code that have no
internal labels.

within each basic block, combine calculations into a list of
statements, usually assignments.  these often can be function
calls where the right hand expression is thrown away.

the major hair here is that the z80 is a two operand machine,
and the expressions we eventually want to emit are 3 operand.

then, group the basic blocks into higher level statements
