           Notes on CP/M Ver. 2.2 with Cbios rev.E.3.




There  are  several  features of Morrow Designs version  of  CP/M 
Version  2.2,  Cbios revision E.3 with which users accustomed  to 
single  density CP/M on 8 inch drives may not  be  familiar.   In 
addition,  some  explanation is required for certain utility com
mands  provided  by Morrow Designs.  These special  features  and 
utilities are discussed below.


CBIOS

The CBIOS supplied with CP/M Version 2.2 has some unique features 
which  allow  users to easily use floppy diskettes  of  different 
densities  and/or  sector sizes.  The CBIOS will read  and  write 
diskettes  formatted  in IBM 3740 single density format  and  IBM 
system  34  double density format.  This compatibility  with  IBM 
diskettes is only in the formatting information,  not in the file 
structure.  This  means that the Disk Jockey 2D/B or Disk  Jockey 
DMA  can read IBM diskettes,  but special software is  needed  to 
read IBM files.  No change is necessary within the CBIOS to allow 
users to read and/or write any of the IBM standard sector sizes. 

The  CBIOS also supports single and  double-sided  drives.  Users 
with double-sided drives must use double-sided diskettes in order 
to  take  advantage  of the built-in  double-sided  features.  If 
single-sided  diskettes  are used in a  double-sided  drive,  the 
single-sided  parameters  of  the  CBIOS  will  take  precedence.  
Likewise,  if a double-sided diskette is inserted and the  system 
is  warm-booted  then the double-sided features will be  switched 
on.  Eg. 3 ms. seeks and extended storage. 

The  CBIOS requires approximately 5K of memory.   The source  for 
the CBIOS is in the file CBIOS&.ASM,  and the source for the COLD 
boot loaders is in the file ABOOT&.ASM.  The two files,  BIOS.COM 
and  CBIOS.COM,  are examples of disk and terminal  I/O  routines 
supplied by Digital Research.


MOVCPM

The  MOVCPM.COM feature of CP/M can be used to directly  relocate 
the "cold boot" loader,  the CBIOS and CP/M. If modifications are 
done  to any of the above,  the MOVCPM.COM program will  relocate 
all but the modified portions correctly. Follow the procedures on 
the  next  page if any of the above sections are modified.  If  a 
relocated CP/M program is created using the command:





     A>movcpm xx

(where xx is the system size or * for auto-sizing) the  relocated 
CP/M will begin executing.  However, the relocated CP/M is highly 
unstable.  In particular,  if a warm boot occurs,  the system may 
not  re-boot  properly.  This  is  not a bug  in  the  MOVCPM.COM 
program,  but  rather  a function of the original  and  relocated 
CP/M's.  It  is recommended that the following procedure be  used 
instead ([RET] means press the RETURN key):

     A>movcpm xx *[RET]
     A>sysgen[RET]

     cold boot the system.

This will insure that the newly relocated CP/M is stable.

For  users  with the hard disk systems,  the  MOVCPM.COM  program 
relocates the CBIOS and BOOT for the hard disk version,  not  for 
the floppy version.


Assigning Density

Users familiar with the Lifeboat/Morrow Designs 2D CP/M Ver. 1.4, 
who  are  accustomed  to  using  the  DENSITY.COM  program,  will 
appreciate  the ability of the current programs to  automatically 
determine  diskette  density.  There is no need  to  inform  CP/M 
Version  2.2  ahead of time of the density of  a  diskette.  Just 
insert  the  diskette,  the rest is taken care of.  Care must  be 
taken,  however,  when removing or replacing a diskette which has 
already been  accessed by CP/M.    A disk reset operation  should 
be  done  either by performing a warm boot,  or by making a  BDOS 
call to reset the disk system (see the CP/M interface guide).

As these new features have been added,  the size of the Cbios has 
grown  to  the  point where the version for  the  double  density 
controller can no longer fit on the first two tracks if formatted 
in  single density.   This means that you can only boot up with a 
diskette  that has been formatted with 1024 byte  double  density 
sectors.














Formatting a Diskette - FORMT#

The command file FORMT#.COM will format,  or initialize, a floppy 
diskette  in any IBM standard format for users with a Disk Jockey 
2D/B floppy disk controller.  Typing 

                  A>FORMT#[RET]

executes a program that inquires the sector size - 128, 256, 512, 
or 1024 bytes - to be formatted,  and the drive - A, B, C, or D - 
where  the  initialization will take place.  The drive  specified 
reflects the floppy drives only, nothing else. Formatting drive A 
formats  the  first  floppy  connected to  the  Disk  Jockey  2D.  
Formatting a diskette will automatically write sector headers for 
the selected sector size.  



Again  note that if your floppies have been added to your  system 
via the INSTALL program,  or if they are drives C:,  D: or above, 
then  the  CP/M drive numbers have nothing to do with FORMT#  and 
that drive A will always be the first floppy disk drive.


Formatting a Diskette - FORMATDJ

The command file FORMATDJ.COM formats and initializes both 5  1/4 
and 8 inch diskettes for the DJDMA floppy disk controller.

This  program  is menu-driven and is therefore self  explanatory.  
Simply enter

          A>FORMATDJ[RET]

and follow the instructions.


Formatting the Hard Disk - FORMATHD and FORMATMW

If   it  is  desired  to  format  the  hard  disk,   the  program 
FORMATHD.COM  (8 and 14 inch hard disks) or FORMATMW.COM  (5  1/4 
inch hard disks) should be used.


CAUTION!
Use  caution with the hard disk format programs:   They erase the 
data on the hard disk and it can not be recovered. If you have to 
format  the  disk,  think about what is on the hard  disk  before 
proceeding.






Reconfiguring a System

To reconfigure the CP/M system for your particular hardware,  you 
need  the  MAC assembler (not included with system  software)  to 
assemble the CBIOS&.ASM and ABOOT&.ASM files.

Many  parameters  of the Cbios can be modified  by  changing  the 
value  of  certain  key  variables  which  are  used  during  the 
assembly.  For  example,  the label MSIZE is used to  adjust  the 
memory  size  of the reconfigured CP/M.   The following  list  of 
equates  were pulled out of the Cbios to give you an idea of  the 
options   available  in  the  CBIOS&.ASM  file.    Refer  to  the 
CBIOS&.ASM file if you want to see a full explanation for some of 
these equates.

                  List of Equates - CBIOS&.ASM

maxhd	equ	0	;Set to number of HDCA3 hard disk drives
maxmw	equ	1	;Set to number of HDDMA hard disks
maxfd	equ	0	;Set to number of 2D/B floppies
maxdm	equ	2	;Set to number of DJ DMA floppies 8"
maxmf	equ	2	;Set to number of DJ DMA floppies 5 1/4"

hdorder	equ	0	;Set the order of logical drives ELSE 0

cm5619	equ	0	;CMI CM-5619
st412	equ	1	;Seagate ST-412
st506	equ	0	;Seagate ST-506

Make a copy of the .ASM files,  then edit the CBIOS&.ASM file for 
your  desired system configuration.   This involves changing  the 
numbers  following  the equ portion of the file  to  reflect  the 
number of drives,  their order within the system, the drive type, 
etc.  Use the following as a guideline for assembling the files:

     A>MAC CBIOS&[RET]

     A>MAC ABOOT&[RET] 

Once the CBIOS&.ASM and ABOOT&.ASM files have been edited and re-
assembled, the following procedure may be used to incorporate the 
new drivers into CP/M:



Enter	

     A>TYPE ABOOT&.PRN[RET]

watch  for  the label "OFFSET" in the  listing,  and  record  its 
value.

Enter	

     A>TYPE CBIOS&.PRN[RET]  

watch  for  the label "OFFSETC" in the listing,  and  record  its 
value.

If  the  BIOSLN  equate was modified,  then we  must  modify  the 
MOVCPM.COM  program to create a CP/M system that matches the  new 
Cbios's  length.   The  following  procedure  will  perform  this 
modification.

    Enter	

          A>DDT MOVCPM.COM[RET]

          -S103[RET]

    Location  103  contains  the  BIOSLN  value  for  the  MOVCPM 
    program.


    Enter	

          0103 15 xx[RET]
          0104 43 .[RET]

    where xx is the first two digits of BIOSLN and press  RETURN.  
    For instance, for a BIOSLN of 1800, type in 18[RET].

    then enter

          -G0[RET]

    to exit DDT.


    Next enter	

          A>SAVE 53 MOVCPM.COM[RET]

    to save the reconfigured MOVCPM program, and
	
          A>MOVCPM xx *[RET]

    where xx is the MSIZE value that you assembled the CBIOS&.ASM 
    file with, then
	
          A>SAVE 48 CPMxx.COM[RET]

    with xx as above.


    Again enter	DDT, this time with the new CP/M system file:

          A>DDT CPMxx.COM[RET]

    The value of xx is as above.


    Enter	

          -HEX[RET]

    then

          -R(value of OFFSETC)[RET]

    Use  the OFFSETC value obtained from the second step in  this 
    procedure.   Be  sure to omit the parenthesis.    Continue by 
    entering
	
          -IBIOS&.HEX[RET]

    then  	

          -R(value of OFFSET)[RET]

    with  the OFFSET value obtained from the first step  in  this 
    procedure.  Finally, enter
     
          -^C (control C) 

    to return to CP/M from DDT.

    Now enter	

          A>SAVE 48 CPMxx.COM[RET]

    with xx as above, and then

          A>SYSGEN[RET]

    SYSGEN returns

          Morrow Designs SYSGEN version 4.1
          Source drive name (or <RETURN> if in memory)

    Answer by pressing the RETURN key.  (At this point the source 
    for  the new  system is in RAM memory,  not on the disk where 
    you want it).  The return:

          Destination drive name (or <RETURN> to warm boot)

    Enter  the destination drive - A through P.  Be careful  about 
    which drives (hard disk or floppy) are drives A,  B,  etc, as 
    this  step  destroys  the original CP/M  on  the  destination 
    drive.

    To complete this process, press the RETURN key twice:

          Destination on (drive):, type <RETURN> to warm boot)
          Function complete

          Destination drive name (or <RETURN> to warm boot)

    Reset  the  system and do a "cold boot."  The  system  header 
    displays your new system size now.



SINGLE COMMAND 

The  program SINGLE.COM is of interest mainly to those users  who 
have  only a single drive system and a DJ 2D/B  controller.   Its 
purpose  is  to  allow  these users to copy  CP/M  files  between 
diskettes.  Users with dual drive systems can perform such copies 
faster and more conveniently simply by using PIP.

SINGLE  operates by intercepting CP/M calls to disk drive  select 
routines.   Rather than selecting a NEW drive, SINGLE prompts the 
user  to  place an "A" or "B" diskette into Drive  A.   In  other 
words,  SINGLE  turns Drive A into a logical dual  drive  system.  
The  user,  however,  must keep track of which diskette  has been 
designated the "A" diskette and which the "B" diskette.  

As an example,  to copy a file from drive B to drive A,  give the 
command:

                  A>SINGLE S[RET]

to  begin  operation  in  single mode (the "S"  argument  is  for 
Start).  The program will respond that SINGLE has been installed, 
and return to CP/M.   Any operation that involves changing drives 
will now result in a prompt to place the "A" or "B" diskette into 
Drive A.   In our example, the "B" diskette would be the one with 
the  file which we wish to copy onto the  system  diskette.   

One could now type:

                  A>PIP A:DEST.FILE=B:SOURCE.FILE[V] [RET]
        
Depending upon the length of the file to be transferred,  a  fair 
number  of requests to place the "A" or "B" diskette into Drive A 
will appear until the copy is completed.   An entire system  disk 
could  also  be backed up this way.  First one would  format  the 
destination disk. Next, the command:

                  A>PIP A:=B:*.*[RET]

would begin the copy.  This process will take many many swaps but 
will  do  the job.  The number of diskette swaps depends  on  the 
amount of memory which PIP has to use,  and on the amount of data 
to be transferred.

In  general,  any CP/M command which can be used in regular  mode 
can  be  used while in single mode.   There are  two  exceptions, 
however.   The FORMT#.COM program,  because it makes direct calls 
to  Disk  Jockey  2D/B firmware,  will not function  properly  in 
single  mode,   and  MOVCPM.COM  because  of  memory   relocation 
problems.

To exit single mode, type:

                  A>SINGLE E[RET]

This  will  return the user to the standard CP/M system (The  "E" 
argument  is for End).   Typing SINGLE E when not in single  mode 
will report an error and return without any change being made, as 
will typing SINGLE S if already in single mode.



REGEN

The  REGEN.COM command regenerates CP/M single density  diskettes 
which  have been formatted in such a way that it is  incompatible 
with  the  normal operation of the 1791  controller  chip  (IMSAI 
diskettes in particular have this problem).  This program will be 
of  interest  to those users with the Morrow Designs Disk  Jockey 
2D/B Controller only.   It is not intended for use with the  Disk 
Jockey DMA controller.

The  REGEN  program is designed to be used with  diskettes  which 
have  been  formatted incorrectly - not with diskettes that  have 
been partially destroyed.  An example of a diskette that could be 
used with the REGEN program is one that the Disk Jockey 1D  board 
can  read,  but  the Disk Jockey 2D/B cannot (the DJ1D  does  not 
utilize the 1791 controller chip). 
   
Essentially, the REGEN program reads a complete track of data and 
format information into memory,  filters out the formatting,  re-
formats  the track and then re-writes the data.   This process is 
repeated  until  the whole diskette has  been  regenerated.   The 
original  diskette is both the source and  destination  diskette, 
and must therefore be write enabled.
    
The  final  result should be a single density  diskette  that  is 
readable  both on the machine that originally produced it as well 
as on the Disk Jockey 2D/B controller.

Simply  typing  REGEN  will invoke this program.  It  has  enough 
prompts to explain its use.


BOOTHD

The program BOOTHD.COM contains a boot strap loader for the  HDCA 
hard disk controller.  BOOTHD.COM could be programmed into a PROM 
so  that  you  could boot directly onto the  hard  disks  without 
having to bother with the floppies.


BOOTMW

The  program  BOOTMW.COM  contains a boot strap  loader  for  the 
HDC/DMA hard disk controller.

The  Morrow  Designs MPZ80 CPU card has both  BOOTHD  and  BOOTMW 
encoded  in its PROM.   Refer to the MPZ80 manual for the  proper 
switch settings.
