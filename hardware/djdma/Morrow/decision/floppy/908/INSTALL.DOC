NAME
    install -- integrate new device drivers into Cpm, Revision 1.3.

SYNOPSIS
    install -string newbios address [ prlfile2 address2 ... ]

DESCRIPTION
    Install integrates new device drivers into an existing Cpm 2 system.
    "Newbios" is a skeletal Cpm bios module in prl format (see the prl
    document) containing the new drivers. Install first loads newbios at
    the given address (usually the top of Cpm), then patches it into the
    existing bios by exchanging the addresses of the 17 jump vectors that
    begin each bios. If additional prlfiles are given, they are loaded at
    the requested addresses with no patching. Finally, install prints
    (top of newbios) + (newbios buffer size, if any) + 1 as the "new load
    address". Additional drivers can now be installed at this address.

    The flagged argument (-string) is copied to 80H and left there for
    examination by the newely installed "Newbios", or a NULL if no
    flagged argument is present. The bios modules provided here (see below)
    use this as an initial drive specification. i.e. -c specifies that the
    newely installed bios should respond to drives C on.

    The Cpm system must be "standard": its bios must begin with the jump
    table defined in the "Cpm 2.0 Alteration Guide", and it must store
    the address of this table at location 1 in memory.

    A "skeletal" bios module begins with the same jump table, but may
    leave some of the required functions unimplimemted. The corresponding
    jump vectors are left as jump selfs.

EXAMPLES
    To install the m26 hard disk as drives C, D, and E in a 48K Cpm
    (assuming that you have memory above 48K), execute

        install -C M26.prl C000

    Here, M26.prl is the "skeletal bios" (provided with install)
    containing the m26 drivers, and C000 (hex for 48K) is the top of Cpm.
    If you only have 48K of memory in your system, you will first have to
    move your Cpm downward to make room. At this writing, the m26 drivers
    require approximately 3.5K bytes, (see FILES below), so you should
    construct a 44K Cpm, and type

        install -C M26.prl B000

    (B000 is 44K in hex.) If you don't know how to move your Cpm downward
    see your system manual. The required program is usually called
    "movcpm".

    To install the Disk Jockey as drives L and M in a 44K Cpm (with at
    least 48K of memory), type

        install  dj.prl  B000  djram.prl  E400

    Here, dj.prl contains the Disk Jockey 2D drivers, B000 is the top of
    the 44K Cpm (the dj drivers require 3.25K), djram.prl is updated
    controller firmware to be loaded into the controller ram, and E400 is
    the address of the controller ram. (If you have a non-standard
    controller, use the controller address + 400 hex.)

    To install both the m26 and the Disk Jockey, you could first install
    one and then install the other on top of it (at the printed "new load
    address"). This would require 6.75K of memory above Cpm. As a better
    alternative, there is a combined driver package that requires only
    5K of memory. To use it, configure a 43K Cpm (assuming 48K of
    memory, or use available memory - 5K), and type

        install  M26+dj.prl  AC00  djram.prl  E400

    prl.doc     Prl file format.
    M26.prl     M26 drivers, require 3.5K, default to drives N,O, and P.
    dj.prl      Dj drivers, require 3.25K, default to drives L and M.
    djram.prl   Dj ramware. Load at controller address + 400 hex.
    M26+dj.prl  Combined m26 and dj drivers, require 5K, default to drives
		L and M for the Disk Jockey, and N,O and P for the M26.

BUGS
    Addresses must be specified in 4-digit hex (with no leading 0 and no
    trailing H). Install should also accept octal and X-notation.

    When the DJ drivers are first accessed, they locate the controller by
    searching memory for a certain pattern in the controller rom. The
    search is done carefully, but nevertheless might clobber somebody's
    memory-mapped io.
