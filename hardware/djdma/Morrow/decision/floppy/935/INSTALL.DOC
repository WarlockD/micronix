NAME
    INSTALL  - integrate new device drivers into  CP/M,  Revision 
               1.3.

SYNOPSIS
    INSTALL - string newbios address [ prlfile2 address2 ... ]

DESCRIPTION
    INSTALL  integrates new device drivers into an existing  CP/M 
    2.x system.  "Newbios" is a skeletal CP/M BIOS module in .PRL 
    format  (see the PRL.DOC  file) containing the  new  drivers. 
    INSTALL  first loads "newbios" at the given address  (usually 
    the  top of CP/M),  then patches it into the existing BIOS by 
    exchanging  the addresses of the 17 jump vectors  that  begin 
    each  BIOS.  If  additional  .PRL files are given,  they  are 
    loaded at the requested addresses with no patching.  Finally, 
    INSTALL  prints 

       (top of newbios) + (newbios buffer size, if any) + 1 

    as  the  "new load address".   Additional drivers can now  be 
    installed at this address.

    The  flagged  argument  (-string) is copied to 80H  and  left 
    there for examination by the newly installed "Newbios",  or a 
    NULL  if  no flagged argument is present.  The  BIOS  modules 
    provided  here  use this as an initial  drive  specification, 
    i.e.,  -c  specifies  that the newly  installed  BIOS  should 
    respond to drives C.

    The  CP/M system must be standard:  its BIOS must begin  with 
    the jump table as defined in the "CP/M 2.0 Alteration Guide", 
    and  it must store the address of this table at location 1 in 
    memory.

    A "skeletal" BIOS module begins with the same jump table, but 
    may leave some of the required functions unimplemented.   The 
    corresponding jump vectors are left as jump-to-selfs.

EXAMPLES
    To install the 14 inch hard disk (M26) as drives C,  D, and E 
    in  a  48K  CP/M (assuming that you have memory  above  48K), 
    execute

        INSTALL -C M26.prl C000

    Here,  M26.prl is the "skeletal BIOS" (provided with INSTALL) 
    containing the 14 inch hard disk drivers,  and C000 (hex  for 
    48K)  is the top of CP/M.   If you only have 48K of memory in 
.pa
    your system,  you will first have to move your CP/M  downward 
    to make room.  At this writing, the 14 inch hard disk drivers 
    required approximately 3.5K bytes,  (see FILES below), so you 
    should construct a 44K CP/M, and type

        INSTALL -C M26.prl B000

    (B000 is 44K in hex.) If you don't know how to move your CP/M 
    downward, see  your system manual.  The required  program  is 
    usually called "MOVCPM".

    To  install  the Disk Jockey as drives L and M in a 44K  CP/M 
    (with at least 48K of memory), type

        INSTALL dj.prl  B000  djram.prl  E400

    Here,  "dj.prl" contains the Disk Jockey 2D drivers,  B000 is 
    the  top  of  the  44K  CP/M  (the  drivers  require  3.25K), 
    "djram.prl"  is updated controller firmware to be loaded into 
    the controller RAM, and E400 is the address of the controller 
    RAM. (If you have a non-standard controller, use the control-
    ler address +400 hex.)

    To  install both the 14 inch hard disk and the  Disk  Jockey 
    drives, you could first install one, then the other on top of 
    it  (at the printed "new load address").  This would  require 
    6.75K of memory above CP/M. As a better alternative, there is 
    a combined driver package that requires only 5K of memory. To 
    use it,  configure a 43K CP/M (assuming 48K of memory, or use 
    available memory minus 5K), and type

        INSTALL M26+dj.prl  AC00  djram.prl  E400

BUGS
    Addresses must be specified in 4-digit hex (with no leading 0 
    and no trailing H).  INSTALL should also accept octal and  X-
    notation.

    When the Disk Jockey drivers are first accessed,  they locate 
    the  controller by searching memory for a certain pattern  in 
    the controller ROM.  The search is done carefully, but never-
    theless, might clobber someone's memory-mapped I/O.
