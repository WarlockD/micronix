NAME
     bad -- bad spot utility program

SYNOPSIS
     bad

DESCRIPTION
    The hard disk format program "formathd" has an option to test
    the disk, leaving a map of any bad spots for future reference.
    (See formathd for the exact location and format of this map.)

    "bad" is a menu style utility program for dealing 
    with this map and prohibiting CP/M file systems from
    accessing the bad locations. There are
    basically three seperate functions performed by "bad": 

	1) read and display the bad map contents, 

	2) add sectors to the bad map

 	3) read the bad map and write CP/M directory entries to allocate
           the bad spots to a CP/M file.

    All three bad functions work on CP/M logical drives, as opposed
    to physical drive units. When a drive is specified in a command
    the drive type is determined by examining the file "vitals.bad"
    on the currently logged drive. If the drive type can not be
    determined then an error is reported.


    Each line in the vitals file consists of fields describing
    the type of drive and where the bad map information may be located. 
    The first line of
    the vitals file is reserved for titling information.
    The fields are:

		cpmspt - The number of CP/M sectors per CP/M track
		cpmdsm - The disk size maximum (see DPH and DPB)
		mapcyl - The cylinder where the bad map lives
		maphed - The head where the bad map lives
		mapsec - The sector where the bad map lives
		maplen - The number of physical sectors the bad map
			 occupies
		ncyls  - The number of physical cylinders on the drive
		nheds  - The number of physical heads on the drive
		nsecs  - The number of physical sectors on the drive
		secsize- The physical sector size
		name   - A short english description of the drive

Following are more detailed descriptions of the sub-functions
of the bad program.


	get	Reads the bad map and displays the contents on the
		console. The format of the output is:

		track	head	sector
		...

		for each entry in the bad map.
		You are asked if you'd like copy of the bad
		sectors list in a file.  If you enter a file
		name, a file is produces containing this list.
		If you simply press return, no file is produced.


	put	You are prompted for track, head, sector
		triplets in the form:

		track	#
		head	#
		sector	#
		...

		until you answer that you have no more sectors
		to enter.  The updated bad map is then written
		back on to the disk.

	fix	Reads a bad map from the specified drive and creates
		CP/M directory entries which effectively allocate the
		bad spot on the disk to the new file. The file is
		hidden form the user by placing it in user 15 and
		making it a system file with write protection. No
		attempt should be made to read or write the file. All
		such created files are given the name "BADSPOTS".

		You will be notified if one of your files contains
		a bad spot.  The proper way to proceed in this case
		is to save as much of the file as possible by 
		copying into another file, then erase the original
		file, then press ^C to ensure the integrity of 
		the in memery CP/M disk allocation bit-map.



    The hard disk is shipped from the factory with any necessary badspot
    files already installed. (Shugart and Memorex do not guarantee freedom
    from bad spots, although they do guarantee a certain maximum, and an
    error-free track 0.) So ordinarily, the hard disk user will not need
    these programs.

    If a new bad spot developes, there are two ways to proceed. The most
    time consuming is to back up the disk, run the formathd program, run
    fixbad, and then restore the disk. Alternatively, if you know the hard
    disk track, head, and sector number of the new bad spot, you can run
    putbad to add the new bad spot to the map and then run fixbad.


BUGS
    It is very difficult to discover the track, head, and sector number
    of a bad spot when Cpm's only error message is "Bdos error on drive
    e: bad sector". Suppliers of Cpm should arrange for more informative
    error messages.

    It is impossible to patch a bad spot which lies in the area of a CP/M
    directory. The only possible way of dealing with this problem is to
    have the CP/M CBIOS handle the bad sector sparing.

    If a bad spot is already allocated to a file there an error message
    to that effect is issued. This means that the bad spot is still
    a potential hazard. The best way around this problem is to fix
    drives with no other files.
