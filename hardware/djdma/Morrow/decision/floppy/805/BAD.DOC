NAME
    getbad -- read the bad-spot map from the hard disk
    putbad -- write a bad-spot map on the hard disk
    fixbad -- protect Cpm from bad spots on the hard disk

SYNOPSIS
    getbad  [ mapdrive ]  [ >mapfile ]
    putbad  [ mapdrive ]  [ <mapfile ]
    fixbad  drive1  [ drive2 [ drive3 ] ]

DESCRIPTION
    The hard disk format program "formathd" has an option to test
    the disk, leaving a map of any bad spots on track 0 for future
    reference. (See formathd for the exact location and format of
    this map.)

    Getbad prints the bad-spot map to the console, or to a file if the
    output has been redirected by >mapfile. The printout format is
        track
        head
        sector
        ...
    one number per line.

    Putbad re-writes the bad-spot map, either from the console (in which
    case prompts are issued), or from a file (in the above format) if the
    input has been redirected by <mapfile.

    Both getbad and putbad take an optional mapdrive argument (the
    default is e). Any logical drive on the desired hard disk will do.

    Fixbad reads the bad-spot map and allocates these spots to "invisible"
    Cpm files on the requested logical drives, thus protecting Cpm from
    future access to these spots. One such file per drive takes care of
    all the bad spots. It is named "BADSPOTS", has user number 15, is
    write protected, and has been given the "system file" attribute so it
    is not listed by dir commands.

EXAMPLES
    The hard disk is shipped from the factory with any necessary badspot
    files already installed. (Shugart and Memorex do not guarantee freedom
    from bad spots, although they do guarantee a certain maximum, and an
    error-free track 0.) So ordinarily, the hard disk user will not need
    these programs.

    If a new bad spot developes, there are two ways to proceed. The most
    time consuming is to back up the disk, run the formathd program, run
    fixbad, and then restore the disk. Alternatively, if you know the hard
    disk track, head, and sector number of the new bad spot, you can run
    getbad to read the badspot map into a file, edit the file to include
    the new bad spot, run putbad to put the new map back onto the disk,
    and then run fixbad.

BUGS
    It is very difficult to discover the track, head, and sector number
    of a bad spot when Cpm's only error message is "Bdos error on drive
    e: bad sector". Suppliers of Cpm should arrange for more informative
    error messages.
